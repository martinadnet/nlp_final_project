another
one
in
my
bag

Where
did
you
buy
them
?

We
all
have
responsibilities
.

All
men
die
.

Tom
is
a
man
.

Therefore
,
Tom
will
die
.

This
is
an
old
letter
.

It
was
a
fine
day
,
so
we
went
swimming
.

After
a
short
visit
he
suddenly
got
up
and
took
his
leave
.

How
much
do
you
leave
for
a
tip
to
a
taxi
driver
in
New York
?

Tom
is
being
silly
,
is
n't
he
?

I
've
rarely
seen
you
so
quiet
.

Time
passed
very
quickly
.

They
contacted
the
station
staff
but
the
man
had
left
the
area
and
gone
out
through
the
ticket
barrier
.

She
always
wears
black
.

The
cat
caught
me
by
surprise
!

Mary
had
a
little
lamb
whose
fleece
was
white
as
snow
.

Tom
must
be
dead
.

I
'm
afraid
we
ca
n't
change
it
.

Nobody
listens
to
us
.

I
said
get
out
.

Tom
is
still
just
as
friendly
as
he
used
to
be
.

That
was
Tom
's
fault
.

I
have
n't
been
to
Boston
since
2013
.

In
Canada
we
sleep
in
a
bed
,
not

the

Jack
is
one
of
my
friends
.

She
's
only
going
to
tell
you
what
she
thinks
you
want
to
hear
.

We
often
compare
Japan
with
Britain
.

He
is
happy
about
the
progress
he
has
recently
made
.

Old
traditions
are
crumbling
away
.

His
story
was
too
ridiculous
for
anyone
to
believe
.

Life
is
so
unfair
sometimes
.

I
do
n't
think
she
'll
be
happy
living
with
her
mother-in-law
.

That
's
a
good
reason
,
I
guess
.

I
already
know
your
secret
.

That
's
why
I
came
.

The
story
reminded
me
of
my
father
.

Seeing
me
,
the
dog
rushed
up
to
me
.

You
say
he
is
a
workaholic
,
but
you
know
there
are
some
people
who
feel
happiest
when
they
're
working

Tom
regularly
eats
sushi
with
his
mother
.

Tom
and
Mary
do
n't
seem
too
busy

I
am
shooting
with
a
Russian
machine-gun

I
met
Tom

January
.

Maybe
you
should
talk
to
Tom
.

It
is
almost
ten o'clock

Why
do
n't
you

politician

Tom
every
day

When
Kate

a
minor
part
in
a

her

a

you

you

blouse

had
no
friend
to

him

For
one
thing
,
I
'm
penniless
;
for
another
,
I
do
n't
have
the

You
are
n't
likely
to
find
that
word
in
a
dictionary
that
's
this
small
.

These
cars
were
imported
from
Germany

"
A

equivalent
to
B

the
same
meaning
as
"
A
is
true

only

B

.

Better
leave
it

Today
I
had
some
kipper
for
breakfast
.

It
seems
that
the
teacher
mistook
me
for
my
older
brother
.

She
's
the
most
beautiful
woman
.

Maybe
we
should
ask
Tom
if
he
wants
this
old
piano
.

Obviously
he
speaks
English
,
but
he
can
even
speak
Spanish
.

I
know
what
he
's
intending
to
do
.

Tom
plans
to
put
new
locks
on
all
the
doors
.

Never
have
I
seen
such
a
thing
.

Tom
should
have
paid
attention
to
what
Mary
said
.

I
remember
mentioning
it
once
or
twice
.

You
never
say
what
you
really
think
.

Soup
was
boiling
in
a
large
cauldron
.

Poverty
is
not
an
accident
.

Like
slavery
and
apartheid
,
it
is
man-made
and
can
be
removed
by
the
actions
of
human beings
.

Why
is
your
French
so
good
?

Do
you
want
him
?

In
the
past
it
was
thought
the
world
was
flat
.

They
're
looking
for
it
.

I
'm
going
to
do
my
best
.

Clothes
make
people
,
rags
make
lice

Would
you
like
to
live
in
Mumbai
?

Tom
warned
us
that
this
might
happen
.

I
had
got
my
camera
stolen
in
the
train

a

Thank
you
for
helping
me
write
my
resume
.

An
old
man
told
his
grandson
,
"
My
son
,
there
is
a
battle
between
two
wolves
inside
us
all
.

One
is
evil
.

It
is
anger
,
jealousy
,
greed
,
resentment
,
inferiority
,
lies
and
ego
.

The
other
is
good
.

It
is
joy
,
peace
,
love
,
hope
,
humility
,
kindness
,
empathy
and
truth
.

"
The
boy
thought
about
it
and
asked
,
"
Grandfather
,
which
wolf
wins
?

"
The
old
man
quietly
replied
,
"
The

feed

"
I
'm

She
started
for
Kyoto
yesterday
.

I
think
Tom
has
come
to
make
trouble
.

You
're
the
only
one
for
me
now
.

Tom
certainly
thinks
he
's
clever
.

We
think
it
is
very
dangerous
that
you
're
climbing
the
mountain
alone
.

I
gave
my
hat
a
brush
.

Mom
is
about
to
enter
the
bath

We
'll

What
's
Glauke

role
?

I
think
that
my
German
is
really
bad
.

I
'm
sorry
,
did
you
say
something
?

The
Colonel
said
the
situation
is
under
control
.

You
should
try
to
enjoy
yourself
.

Tom
did
n't
even
offer
Mary
a
cup
of
coffee
.

Yes
,
Sir
!

Albert Einstein
's
theory
of
relativity
is
the
most
famous
formula
in
the
world

Why
did
n't
somebody
stop
her
?

You
know
where
the
problem
lies
.

I
recall

my
childhood

There
was
an

My
blood

no
redder
than
yours

Tom
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kidnapping
.

Tom
should
be
there
.

These
computers

Did
you
remember
to

How

have
you
been
married
to
Tom

I
do
n't
love
you

'd
like
to
talk
to
you

The

was
I
trying
to
fool
when
I
cut
that
slice

The
game

be
called
off

me

Anybody

Florence

a
subordinate

Tom
does
n't
remember
the
last
time
I
saw
Mary
.

I
bought
a
guidebook
for
the
museums

should
've
done
this
months

n't
be

know

were
Canadian

your
medication

Pocket
calculators
are
as
cheap
to
buy
as
a
pair
of
socks

and
as
essential
to
thousands
of
British
school
children
as
a
pencil
and
eraser
.

That
strong
light
blinds
me

We
adjourned
the
meeting

the
following
Friday

We
've
been
friends

Many
people
around
the

eat
three
meals

The
cube

Tom
is
extremely
gullible

Tom
's
meeting
with
his
boss
was
very
tense
.

You
have
come
too
soon
.

Tom
actually
did
that
.

Those
selected
will
have
to
face
extensive
medical
and
psychological
tests
.

It
says
in
the
Bible
,
"
Man
shall
not
live

bread
alone

"
Tom
does
n't
do
much
,
does
he
?

Tom
told
the
men
sitting
around
the
table
that
he
'd
never
played
poker
before

She
's
on
the
rolls

I
want
to
see
them

Tom
and
I
are
lifeguards
.

Tom
has
never
been
skiing

This
is
the
video
I
wanted
to
see
.

Pick
on
somebody
your
own
size
,
you
bully
.

Will
you
look
after
my
children
for
me
?

Has
Tom
ever
told
you
how
he
met
Mary
?

The
method
was
too
expensive
to
be
practical
.

You
've
helped
me
a
lot
.

They
got
married
three
months
later
.

He
makes
no
disguise
of
his
feelings
.

It
takes
two
to
tango
.

Chris
did
n't
have
a
car
to
drive
.

She
always
wears
clothes
which
are
out
of
fashion
.

His
scheme
went
wrong
in
the
end
.

He
woke
up
of
himself
.

He
has
n't
got
over
the
death
of
his
wife
yet
.

We
regard
him
as
an
important
man
.

She
tried
to
persuade
him
to
buy
her
a
pearl
necklace
.

Please
give
me
a
cupful
of
rice
.

It
's
an
old
stereotype

Newton's Second Law
says
:
"
Force
is
equal
to
the
change
in
momentum
per
change
in
time
.

For
a
constant
mass
,
force
equals
mass
times
acceleration

.

Tom
said
goodnight
to
Mary
.

I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
I
thought
about
you
as
soon
as
I
read
this
.

I
'm
angry
with
my
boyfriend
for
forgetting
about
Valentine's Day
.

I
'd
like
to
make
a
call

He
's
your
father

I
want
to
know

I
can
do

In

Turks

Vienna

Tolerance

crime

I
have
had
a
slight
fever

this
morning

look

father

What
time
is
your
plane

Tom
's
changed
so
much
that
I
do
n't
think
you
'd
recognize
him
if
you
saw
him

proud

would
make
her
laugh

start
.

You
ca
n't
let
that
come
between
you
and
Tom
.

I
hate
these
words
.

This
kind
of
dog
exists
only
in
Japan
.

What
is
today
's
recommendation
?

Did
you
get
in
touch
with
them
?

Tom
says
he
's
having
trouble
with
his
computer
.

I
read
a
book
as
I
walked
.

I
met
my
teacher
on
the
way
to
the
railway
station
.

She
won
a
medal
when
she
was
just
15
years
old
.

He
went
to
the
store
just
as
it
was
going
to
close
.

The
buds
began
to
open
.

There
are
many
islands
in
Greece
.

How
long
have
you
been
living
in
Boston
?

Days
go
by
and
still
no
sign
of
Tom
.

You
're
braver
than
I
am
.

It
is
a
fact
that
smoking
is
bad
for
health
.

Her
mother
is
a
pornstar
.

If
it
is
n't
broken
,
do
n't
fix
it
.

Tom
is
a
refugee
.

Tom
,
Mary
and
John
spent
Saturday
practicing
for
the
talent
show
.

Here
's
to
you
!

In
the
German
language
there
are
many
long
words
.

They
both
like
the
same
girl
.

Someone
should
talk
turkey
to
him
.

Instead
of
waiting
for
Tom
,
let
's
eat
now
before
the
food
gets
cold
.

It
is
said
that
he
knows
the
secret
.

Do
I
have
to
make
a
speech
?

What
Tom
really
wanted
was
a
new
guitar
.

He
has
just
arrived
here
.

He
took
her
out
for
a
drive
.

How
's
the
dog
?

The
policeman
seized
the
boy
by
the
arm
.

I
am
very
tired
from
swimming
.

We
do
n't
know
what
the
next
day
will
bring
.

I
thought
she
was
pretty
.

Tom
had
to
explain
the
joke
to
Mary
.

Nothing
is
so
valuable
as
friendship
.

I
never
drank
any
thing
but
soda
.

Tom
may
be
wrong
.

You
can
take
or
leave
my
suggestions
,
as
you
wish
.

It
's
no
skin
off
my
nose
.

This
is
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
see
.

I
want
to
be
as
rich
as
Tom
.

Grennan
found
the
translation
of
Leopardi
very
difficult
.

His
acts
of
courage
brought
him
glory
.

Why
do
n't
you
just
ask
them
?

My
opinion
is
the
one
that
counts
!

I
met
my
friend
on
the
street
.

I
'll
never
see
him
again
as
long
as
I
live
.

Will
you
stop
answering
my
questions
with
a
question
?

I
never
thought
it
'd
be
this
hard
to
create
an
iPad
app
.

This
is
n't
the
first
time
I
've
ridden
a
bicycle
.

We
are
living
in
the
atomic
age
.

I
do
n't
want
to
have
any
secrets
from
you
.

My
income
falls
short
of
my
expenditure
by
five hundred
pounds
.

Tom
's
eyes
lit
up
when
Mary
walked
into
the
room
.

Friendship
is
the
most
precious
of
all
.

They
think
it
was
arson
.

It
's
possible
that
we
wo
n't
be
able
to
eat
tuna
in
the
future
.

She
has
a
cold
and
is
absent
from
school
.

I
have
to
warn
him
.

How
is
the
climate
in
your
country
?

She
removed
her
wet
socks
.

Tom
reminded
Mary
to
go
to
the
bank
before
5:00
.

He
has
perfect
teeth
.

I
can
tell
my
best
friend
anything
.

His
job
has
to
do
with
printing
.

In
those
days
,
there
were
no
radios
.

Thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.

Call
us
when
you
get
there
.

Tom
laughs
a lot
.

Oh
,
the
train
is
being
delayed
.

Tom
had
a
bright
idea
.

Keep
the
door
locked
.

I
thought
we
were
going
out
to
dinner
.

I
was
born
during
the
Cold War
.

It
seems
to
me
that
he
likes
music
.

She
is
much
younger
than
Tom
.

Tom
and
Mary
agreed
on
everything
.

Tom
did
n't
write
Mary
back
.

That
's
my
theory
.

She
looks
down
on
me
for
not
having
a
sense
of
humor
.

She
could
n't
keep
from
crying
.

"
Where
are
my
keys
?

"
"
They
are
in
my
handbag
.

"
It
was
n't
easy
for
him
to
keep
his
promise
.

There
lived
a
pretty
girl
in
the
village
.

You
lied
to
us
,
did
n't
you
?

The
new
document
system
is
worth
$
4,000
.

A
lot
of
back
problems
can
be
attributed
to
poor
sitting
posture
.

Can
you
help
Tom
?

It
's
more
fun
to
play
baseball
than
to
watch
it
.

Tom
got
off
at
the
next
bus
stop
.

What
a
jungle
!

At
home
,
we
only
speak
French
.

We
're
on
the
same
side
,
Tom
.

I
'm
really
glad
you
're
here
.

You
've
been
through
a
lot
,
have
n't
you
?

As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
have
no
objection
to
the
plan
.

I
wonder
who
the
people
I
saw
her
with
were
.

I
'm
not
sure
if
that
's
a
good
idea
.

Tom
is
not
playing
by
the
rules
.

Internet
is
very
slow
.

She
is
now
on
vacation
.

Whoever
is
born
in
Austria
,
is
an
Austrian
.

Tom
arrived
too
early
.

Tom
has
fallen
in
love
with
Mary
.

This
time
,
I
really
mean
it
.

He
never
speaks
of
the
accident
.

The
rooster
crows
at
sunrise
.

We
'd
better
hurry
.

I
do
n't
want
to
be
late
for
the
concert
.

They
relaxed
in
front
of
the
fire
.

Could
you
not
do
that
here
?

Do
you
really
want
to
know
what
happened
?

This
woman
definitely
knows
that
she
does
n't
know
what
she
wants
.

I
'll
do
it
myself
.

How
many
weeks
are
there
in
a
month
?

I
am
calling
from
Germany
.

Joe
was
pleased
at
the
thought
of
going
to
New York
.

Is
Boston
far
away
?

What
's
the
next
step
to
be
done
?

Tom
dreamed
of
her
often
.

I
would
like
to
give
him
a
present
for
his
birthday
.

Tom
does
n't
seem
to
have
any
self-confidence
.

Are
you
interested
in
art
?

Seize
the
moments
of
happiness
,
love
and
be
loved
!

That
is
the
only
reality
in
the
world
,
all
else
is
folly
.

It
is
the
one
thing
we
are
interested
in
here
.

They
want
to
change
the
law
.

It
's
strange
that
she
came
home
so
late
at
night
.

How
long
would
it
take
to
swim
across
the
river
?

I
was
distressed
to
see
Tom
so
un
happy
.

We
'll
have
to
come
back
.

When
do
you
work
?

This
is
too
good
to
be
true
.

We
do
n't
have
a
whole
lot
of
time
.

She
works
as
an
assistant
to
the
manager
.

What
are
you
trying
to
do
?

Turkey
did
not
qualify
in
this
year
's
World Cup
.

There
was
a
light
rain
yesterday
.

A
skull
shaped
asteroid
flew
by
the
Earth
on
Halloween
.

I
know
what
that
piece
of
paper
is
.

I
am
hearing
a
voice
.

You
said
she
was
kind
and
so
she
is
.

You
could
learn
a
lot
from
them
if
you
'd
only
listen
.

What
's
the
thirteenth
month
?

Mary
broke
up
with
me
.

This
glass
is
dirty
.

I
've
looked
everywhere
.

I
have
a
great
deal
to
do
.

We
saw
her
on
the
beach
.

My
children
have
to
stay
indoors
after
dark
.

Why
are
you
shouting
?

Where
did
we
leave
off
last
time
?

It
is
to
his
advantage
.

They
're
all
mine
.

I
feel
a
good
cry
coming
on
.

I
was
n't
quite
sure
what
to
say
.

May
I
take
your
order
?

Tom
accepted
the
invitation
.

College
graduates
earn
on
average
over
fifty
per cent
more
than
those
with
only
a
high-school
degree
.

Let
's
take
the
Intercity-Express
.

You
made
the
same
mistake
as
last
time
.

Come
to
Romania
again
.

Children
do
n't
grow
up
speaking
pidgin
languages
;
they
turn
them
into
real
languages
:
creoles
.

What
do
you
usually
eat
with
red wine
?

Being
sick
,
I
had
to
stay
home
.

We
've
received
thirteen
complaints
so
far
this
week
.

Tom
asked
Mary
not
to
wake
him
up
before
seven
.

She
really
looks
pretty
.

Tom
usually
shows
up
on
time
.

He
could
swim
fast
enough
to
pass
the
test
.

I
know
the
artist
who
painted
this
picture
.

I
do
n't
know
why
I
'm
here
.

I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
tomorrow
.

My
father
was
busy
.

I
need
someone
to
talk
to
.

Many
kiss
the
hand
they
wish
to
cut
off
.

Not
to
advance
is
to
go
back
.

He
's
ready
to
go
.

My
father
does
nothing
but
watch
TV
on
Sundays
.

The
baby
kept
crying
all
night
.

This
is
what
I
'm
paying
you
for
.

Are
you
studying
English
every
day
?

Fall
begins
in
October
.

I
have
to
use
the
dictionary
.

Tom
told
Mary
that
he
'd
go
to
Boston
in
October
.

I
had
my
thirtieth
birthday
last
week
.

Tokyo
seems
to
have
got
the
message
from
Washington
.

How
are
the
children
?

I
like
to
eat
watermelon
.

I
want
to
stay
.

He
himself
tried
it
.

The
chair
was
too
high
,
and
I
found
myself
with
my
legs
hanging
in
the
air
.

Tom
and
Mary
stopped
hugging
.

Christmas
is
coming
soon
.

I
'm
sick
of
being
sick
.

It
is
not
known
who
has
the
authority
in
this
matter
.

Many
could
not
hear
him
.

Tom
does
n't
like
girls
who
wear
a
lot
of
makeup
.

The
old
lady
has
been
rather
feeble
since
her
illness
.

Who
's
your
favorite
country
musician
?

I
almost
never
listen
to
the
radio
.

You
should
have
consulted
your
lawyer
.

Daddy
,
let
's
make
faces
at
each other
and
see
who
can
keep
from
laughing
the
longest
.

How
much
did
the
glasses
cost
?

Mary
is
as
tall
as
Tom
is
.

Tom
earns
three
times
as
much
as
me
.

She
must
be
mad
at
you
.

I
'll
be
back
at
six-thirty
.

I
think
he
's
telling
the
truth
.

How
are
you
doing
,
Tom
?

My
grandmother
passed
away
.

Eight
plus
two
is
ten
.

It
will
take
an
hour
to
get
there
.

How
's
married
life
going
?

This
shop
carries
men
's
clothing
.

Ah
...
maybe
tonight
...
Why
did
n't
you
stay
in
Germany
?

Tom
told
me
that
he
would
help
us
.

We
'll
go
on
a
picnic
next
Sunday
.

You
look
really
pale
.

Are
you
all right
?

I
want
you
to
return
to
your
seat
.

He
is
a
man
of
warm
heart
.

Somebody
's
at
the
front door
.

Tom
likes
to
stay
home
and
read
books
on
weekends
.

Tom
's
house
is
easy
to
find
.

We

n't
want

The
police
are
checking
their
bags
.

Oh
,
would
you
catch
the
phone
for
me
,
please
?

I
think
you
know
why
I
ca
n't
do
that
.

A
hero
is
often
just
a
person
who
does
n't
have
the
ability
to
recognise
danger
.

A
stranger
came
into
the
building
.

I
wonder
what
's
wrong
.

That
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
.

Everybody
is
subject
to
law
.

He
had
huge
mood
swings
.

She
asked
for
a
picture
.

He
went
to
Paris
,
where
he
met
me
for
the
first
time
.

She
has
a
double-barrelled
name
.

Forget
the
anxieties
of
life
and
learn
to
relax
.

I
like
to
cut
up
wood
in
my
backyard
.

I
'm
17
,
too
.

Tom
left
for
home
well
over
an
hour
ago
.

She
crawled
out
of
bed
.

You
had
better
go
and
thank
her
in
person
.

Brian

How
much
property
does
the
landlord
own
?

One
should
keep
one
's
promises
.

Tom
ca
n't
swim
very
well
yet
.

Tom
does
n't
look
happy
.

Is
this
your
bike
?

You
gave
Tom
the
money
he
asked
for
,
did
n't
you
?

I
do
n't
want
to
work
at
a
supermarket
all
my
life
.

We
've
run
short
of
oil
.

I
hear
voices
in
my
head
.

I
need
to
speak
to
you
about
something
.

Tom
is
never
going
to
give
up
trying
.

I
do
n't
see
anything
.

Tom
wanted
to
find
a
creative
way
to
tell
Mary
that
he
loved
her
.

Let
me
see
.

There
were
fifteen
people
.

Put
yourself
in
my
position
.

He
never
counts
on
my
help
.

The
rain
soaked
through
my
clothes

Maybe
she
likes
you
,
too
.

This
year
the
circus
has
ten
elephants
.

Tom
asked
me
to
go
with
Mary
.

Tom
loves
to
lie
in
the
grass
on
a
sunny
day
.

Tom
helped
Mary
steal
the
jewels
.

It
â€™s
the
first
time
that
I
read
the
Bible
.

There
is
trouble
brewing
.

We
were
as
one
in
our
opinion
.

Tom
is
sad
,
as
in
German
sentences
he
is
often
separated
from
Mary
by
a
comma
.

We
had
snow
this
morning
.

What
's
happening
here
?

The
rest
of
us
all
had
the
smoked
salmon
.

Why
did
n't
she
tell
me
?

Tom
is
as
tall
as
his
father
.

He
knows
a
lot
about
foreign
affairs
.

I
studied
Chinese
in
Beijing
.

Have
they
announced
the
court
's
decision
yet
?

I
arrived
in
London
.

The
plot
to
assassinate
the
president
was
discovered
just
in
time
.

I
want
to
buy
a
pair
of
ski
boots
.

Tom
told
me
to
wait
outside
.

It
looks
like
Mary
is
drunk
again
.

No
thanks
,
I
'm
pregnant
.

The
information
counts
for
much
to
us
.

I
have
five
copies
but
I
need
double
that
.

It
is
better
to
live
one
day
as
a
lion
than
100
years
as
a
sheep
.

He
has
started
acting
strangely
.

Mary
could
be
a
model
.

Neither
God
nor
Master
.

After
a
day
of
visiting
the
amusement
park
,
the
children
fell
asleep
on
the
car
ride
home
.

I
'm
ashamed
of
what
my
fellow
professionals
and
I
have
done
during
the
past
.

Is
that
why
you
called
me
?

Tom
has
a
Swiss
bank
account
.

I
've
been
to
the
mall
.

He
was
named
after
his
grandfather
.

I
gave
him
a
huge
hug
.

Tom
wanted
to
become
a
Canadian
citizen
.

I
wanted
to
help
Tom
understand
what
Mary
was
trying
to
tell
him
.

Have
you
told
Tom
what
to
buy
?

He
might
have
missed
the
last
train
.

Tom
thought
Mary
was
exaggerating
.

I
ca
n't
take
you
to
work
with
me
.

Iron
is
a
very
useful
metal
.

Wait
for
the
bread
to
completely
cool
down
before
eating
it
.

Tom
has
never
cheated
on
his
wife
.

It
is
the
secret
for
improving
one
self
.

I
've
been
stung
by
a
hornet
.

The
man
who
lives
next
to
Tom
is
quite
peculiar
.

May
I
see
that
blouse
,
please
?

In
the
distance
we
saw
the
island
.

These
letters
,
in
the
main
,
are
from
my
mother
.

It
is
n't
worthwhile
going
there
.

I
'd
hate
to
be
in
Tom
's
shoes
.

"
What
's
the
reason
for
your
allergy
this
time
?

Is
it
the
olive
oil
in
the
salad
?

"
"
No
,
it
's
the
tomatoes
.

"
What
's
your
favorite
commercial
?

I
believe
him
to
be
intelligent
.

How
long
has
he
lived
in
London
?

Life
is
too
short
to
seek
perfection
in
material
things
.

I
would
like
to
try
the
blue
striped
skirt
.

That
's
discouraging
.

How
many
guests
did
you
invite
?

Tom
almost
never
makes
a
mistake
.

Tom
lowered
the
bucket
into
the
well
.

He
's
the
oldest
son
.

After
we
had
eaten
,
we
went
outside
to
skate
.

Tom
never
would
've
done
this
.

You
're
doing
it
on
purpose
!

I
know
not
with
what
weapons
World War III
will
be
fought
,
but
World War IV
will
be
fought
with
sticks
and
stones
.

I
'm
afraid
that
she
'll
refuse
my
request
.

Has
Tom
ever
eaten
at
this
restaurant
?

You
should
apologize
to
Dad
for
not
coming
home
in
time
for
supper
.

He
reached
for
the
pistol
.

Many
a
man
believes
the
story
.

She
's
a
good
actress
and
she
's
really
pretty
.

Sally
is
two
years
older
than
Ken
.

Tom
and
Mary
are
planning
to
have
a
house
built
after
they
have
their
first
child
.

This
is
just
the
type
of
car
I
want
.

At
school
,
I
've
learned
to
write
Latin
.

Catholics
are
against
birth
control
.

I
will
remove
the
labels
tagging
the
above
sentences
.

He
was
compelled
to
sign
the
contract
.

There
were
a
lot
of
people
at
Tom
's
funeral
.

You
do
n't
speak
French
,
do
you
?

Some
families
spend
their
vacation
near
the
beach
.

Stop
being
so
bull-headed
!

I
took
a
bus
so
I
would
n't
be
late
for
my
appointment
.

Do
n't
be
so
greedy
.

The
first
thing
you
should
do
is
call
a
lawyer
.

Tom
lived
in
an
interesting
part
of
Boston
.

"
Thank
you
,
I
'd
love
to
have
another
piece
of
cake
,

said
the
shy
young
man
.

It
's
nice
that
Tom
finally
has
a
hobby
.
