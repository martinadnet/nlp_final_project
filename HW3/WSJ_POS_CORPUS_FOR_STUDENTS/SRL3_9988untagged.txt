Tom

This

fine
day

so
we
went
swimming

After

short
visit

got
up

took
his
leave

How
much
do
you
leave
for
a
tip
to
a
taxi
driver
in
New York

Tom
is
being
silly
,
is
n't
he
?

I
've
rarely
seen
you
so
quiet

Time
passed
very
quickly

They
contacted
the
station
staff
but
the
man
had
left
the
area
and
gone
out

the
ticket
barrier

She
always
wears
black

The
cat
caught
me
by
surprise

Mary
had

little

fleece
was
white
as

Tom
must
be
dead
.

I
'm
afraid
we
ca
n't
change
it
.

Nobody
listens
to
us
.

I
said
get
out
.

Tom
is
still
just
as
friendly
as
he
used
to
be
.

That
was
Tom
's
fault

We
often
compare
Japan
with
Britain

He
is
happy
about
the
progress
he
has
recently
made
.

Old
traditions
are
crumbling
away
.

His
story
was
too
ridiculous
for
anyone
to
believe
.

Life
is
so
unfair
sometimes
.

I
do
n't
think
she
'll
be
happy
living
with
her
mother-in-law
.

That
's
a
good
reason
,
I
guess
.

I
already
know
your
secret
.

That
's
why
I
came
.

The
story
reminded
me
of
my
father
.

Seeing
me
,
the
dog
rushed
up
to
me
.

You
say
he
is
a
workaholic
,
but
you
know
there
are
some
people
who
feel
happiest
when
they
're
working
.

Tom
regularly
eats
sushi
with
his
mother
.

Tom
and
Mary
do
n't
seem
too
busy
.

I
am
shooting
with
a
Russian
machine-gun
.

I
met
Tom
this
January
.

Maybe
you
should
talk
to
Tom
.

It
is
almost
ten o'clock
.

Why
do
n't
you
give
your
wife
a
little
thanks
?

This

What

I
'm
sure
Tom
will
be
here
soon
.

A
politician
who
makes
lots
of

about
Tom
every
day

When
Kate
played
a
minor
part
in

fell

I
need
to
have
a
talk
with
you
.

I
'd
like
to
see
you
again
.

Here
comes
a
bus
.

We
might
as
well
take
it
.

She
was
dressed
in
a
red
blouse
.

There
are
only
two
possibilities
.

I
know
!

And
let
me
also
say
that
Keiko
is
a
SECOND
cousin
of
mine
.

I
met
again
the
girl
who
I
had
met
in
the
park
the
other

When
is
it
OK

This

I
do

another
choice

Let
's
not
argue
anymore
.

How
do
you
kids
do
it
?

He
that
talks
much
,
errs
much
.

The
bridge
collapsed
when
one
of
the
cables
broke
.

Tom
vowed
to
rescue
Mary
.

I
ca
n't
get
any
work
done
here
with
all
these
children
in
the
room
.

I
've
got
to
find
out
what
Tom
knows
.

Tom
found
me
a
good
place
to
live
.

I
'm
trying
to
find
the
person

,
"
My
son
,
there
is
a
battle
between

all
.

One
is
evil
.

It
is
anger
,
jealousy
,
greed
,
resentment
,
inferiority
,
lies
and
ego
.

The
other
is
good
.

It
is
joy
,
peace
,
love
,
hope
,
humility
,
kindness
,
empathy
and
truth
.

"
The
boy
thought
about
it
and
asked
,

Grandfather
,
which
wolf
wins
?

"
The
old
man
quietly
replied
,
"
The
one

come
to
make
trouble

You
're
the
only
one

me
now
.

Tom
certainly
thinks
he
's
clever
.

We
think
it
is
very
dangerous

're
climbing

an
explanation

My
blood
is
no
redder
than
yours

Tom
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
kidnapping

you
been
married

I

love
you

I
'd
like
to

I
took
a

remember

Many
people

They

Pocket
calculators
are
as
cheap
to

as
a
pair
of
socks
,
and
as
essential
to
thousands
of
British
school
children
as
a
pencil
and
eraser
.

That
strong
light
blinds
me
.

We
adjourned
the
meeting
until
the
following
Friday
.

We
've
been
friends

Many

Tom
's
meeting
with
his

Those
selected
will

,
"
Man
shall
not
live
on
bread
alone
.

"
Tom
does
n't
do
much
,
does
he
?

Tom
told
the
men
sitting
around
the
table
that
he
'd
never
played
poker
before
.

She
's
on
the
rolls
.

I
want
to
see
them
!

Tom
and
I
are
lifeguards
.

Tom
has
never
been
skiing
.

This
is
the
video
I
wanted
to
see
.

Pick
on
somebody
your
own
size
,
you
bully
.

Will
you
look
after
my
children
for
me
?

Has
Tom
ever
told
you
how
he
met
Mary
?

The
method
was
too
expensive
to
be
practical
.

You
've
helped
me
a
lot
.

They

married

months

He

Chris
did
n't
have
a

to
drive
.

She
always
wears
clothes
which
are
out

His
scheme
went
wrong
in
the
end
.

He
woke
up
of
himself
.

He
has
n't
got
over
the
death
of
his
wife
yet
.

We
regard
him
as
an
important
man
.

She
tried
to
persuade
him
to
buy
her
a
pearl
necklace
.

Please
give
me
a
cupful
of
rice
.

It
's
an
old
stereotype
.

Newton's Second Law
says
:
"
Force
is
equal
to
the
change
in
momentum
per
change
in
time
.

For
a
constant
mass
,
force
equals
mass
times
acceleration
"
.

Tom
said
goodnight
to
Mary
.

I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
I
thought
about
you
as
soon
as
I
read
this
.

I
'm
angry
with
my
boyfriend
for
forgetting
about
Valentine's Day
.

I
'd
like
to
make
a
call
.

He
's
your
father
.

I
want
to
know
what
I
can
do

Tom
should
have
discussed
the
matter
with
me
.

"
Is
that
a
Ferrari
or
a
Lamborghini
?

"
"
It
's
a
Maserati
.

"
The
fog
prevented
the
planes
from
taking
off
.

The
newspaper
called
for
the
government
to
stop
inflation
.

If
you
want
to
go
,
then
go
.

Put
a
dash
of
brandy
in
my
tea
.

Dad
's
in
an
impatient
mood
today
.

If
I
send
it
by
air
mail
,
how
much
will
it
cost
?

Tolerance
becomes
a
crime
when
applied
to
evil
.

I
have
had
a
slight
fever
since
this
morning
.

A
friend
of
mine
made
it
with
a
mask
.

Let
's
hope
she
's
all right
.

Must
I
clean
the
room
?

Unfortunately
,
these
beautiful
words
are
not
mine
.

This
soup
has
no
substance
.

Tom
does
n't
look
like
his
father
.

What
time
is
your
plane
?

Tom
's
changed
so
much
that
I
do
n't
think
you
'd
recognize
him
if
you
saw
him
.

I
'm
proud
that
my
father
is
a
good
cook
.

They
searched
the
house
,
but
found
no
clues
.

The
mother
put
the
children
to
bed
.

Tom
put
on
his
gloves
.

Tom
wants
us
to
go
to
church
.

Persistence
will
pay
off
.

How
many
were
there
?

What
is
the
English
for
"
kaisha
"
?

Do
you
see
the
star
?

We
use
really
state-of-the-art
equipment
.

Do
you
have
the
same
thing
in
a
different
color
?

I
thought
it
would
make
her
laugh
.

I
saw
him
again
.

Here
is
the
map
.

"
You
never
told
me
that
!

"
"
Yes
,
I
did
!

"
I
worked
as
if
there
were
no
tomorrow
.

Insects
are
very
nutritious
and
a
good
source
of
proteins
.

I
called
you
because
I
need
to
ask
you
a
question
.

Sumo
wrestling
is
a
traditional
Japanese
sport
.

Where
did
you
put
them
?

I
met
him
on
Friday
the
13th
.

My
watch
says
2:30
.

Tell
us
about
that
.

Tom
tried
to
pry
open
the
window
with
a
screwdriver
.

How
can
we
prove
that
?

Delegates
debated
the
compromise
for
many
days
.

The
dinner
was
very
good
.

It
is
a
pleasure
to
watch
a
baseball game
on
TV
.

He
broke
his
promise
,
which
was
a
big
mistake
.

Tom
has
his
father
's
eyes
.

Will
you
please
call
me
this
evening
?

What
's
Tom
's
job
?

I
am
sorry
for
you
.

Is
there
a
hospital
near
here
?

No
man
hath
seen
God
at
any
time
;
the
only
begotten
Son
,
which
is
in
the
bosom
of
the
Father
,
he
hath
declared
him
.

The
next
morning
I
woke
to
see
the
fruit
trees
in
bloom
underneath
my
window
.

This
sentence
is
too
long
.

George
was
always
my
favorite
.

That
sentence
does
n't
exist
in
any
song
.

You
have
a
poor
memory
!

An
independent
advisor
has
been
brought
in
to
conciliate
between
the
unions
and
the
employer
.

Tom
and
John
pretended
they
were
brothers
.

I
stopped
working
for
Tom
three
years
ago
.

I
'm
really
sorry
about
Tom
.

We
saw
the
car
start
.

You
ca
n't
let
that
come
between
you
and
Tom
.

I
hate
these
words
.

This
kind
of
dog
exists
only
in
Japan
.

What
is
today
's
recommendation
?

Did
you
get
in
touch
with
them
?

Today
I
'm
eating
an
apple
.

Yesterday
I
ate

Tomorrow
I
'll
eat
an
apple
.

Tom
says
he
's
having
trouble
with
his
computer
.

I
read
a
book
as
I
walked
.

I
met
my
teacher
on
the
way
to
the
railway
station
.

She
won
a
medal
when
she
was
just
15
years
old
.

He
went
to
the
store
just
as
it
was
going
to
close
.

The
buds
began
to
open
.

There
are
many
islands
in
Greece
.

How
long
have
you
been
living
in
Boston
?

Days
go
by
and
still
no
sign
of
Tom
.

You
're
braver
than
I
am
.

It
is
a
fact
that
smoking
is
bad
for
health
.

Her
mother
is
a
pornstar
.

If
it
is
n't
broken
,
do
n't
fix
it
.

Tom
is
a
refugee
.

Tom
,
Mary
and
John
spent
Saturday
practicing
for
the
talent
show
.

Here
's
to
you
!

In
the
German
language
there
are
many
long
words
.

They
both
like
the
same
girl
.

Someone
should
talk
turkey
to
him
.

Instead
of
waiting
for
Tom
,
let
's
eat
now
before
the
food
gets
cold
.

It
is
said
that
he
knows
the
secret
.

Do
I
have
to
make
a
speech
?

What
Tom
really
wanted
was
a
new
guitar
.

He
has
just
arrived
here
.

He
took
her
out
for
a
drive
.

How
's
the
dog
?

The
policeman
seized
the
boy
by
the
arm
.

I
am
very
tired
from
swimming
.

We
do
n't
know
what
the
next
day
will
bring
.

I
thought
she
was
pretty
.

Tom
had
to
explain
the
joke
to
Mary
.

Nothing
is
so
valuable
as
friendship
.

I
never
drank
any
thing
but
soda
.

Tom
may
be
wrong
.

You
can
take
or
leave
my
suggestions
,
as
you
wish
.

It
's
no
skin
off
my
nose
.

This
is
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
see
.

I
want
to
be
as
rich
as
Tom
.

Grennan
found
the
translation
of
Leopardi
very
difficult
.

His
acts
of
courage
brought
him
glory
.

Why
do
n't
you
just
ask
them
?

My
opinion
is
the
one
that
counts
!

I
met
my
friend
on
the
street
.

I
'll
never
see
him
again
as
long
as
I
live
.

Will
you
stop
answering
my
questions
with
a
question
?

I
never
thought
it
'd
be
this
hard
to
create
an
iPad
app
.

This
is
n't
the
first
time
I
've
ridden
a
bicycle
.

We
are
living
in
the
atomic
age
.

I
do
n't
want
to
have
any
secrets
from
you
.

My
income
falls
short
of
my
expenditure
by
five hundred
pounds
.

Tom
's
eyes
lit
up
when
Mary
walked
into
the
room
.

Friendship
is
the
most
precious
of
all
.

They
think
it
was
arson
.

It
's
possible
that
we
wo
n't
be
able
to
eat
tuna
in
the
future
.

She
has
a
cold
and
is
absent
from
school
.

I
have
to
warn
him
.

How
is
the
climate
in
your
country
?

She
removed
her
wet
socks
.

Tom
reminded
Mary
to
go
to
the
bank
before
5:00
.

He
has
perfect
teeth
.

I
can
tell
my
best
friend
anything
.

His
job
has
to
do
with
printing
.

In
those
days
,
there
were
no
radios
.

Thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.

Call
us
when
you
get
there
.

Tom
laughs
a lot
.

Oh
,
the
train
is
being
delayed
.

Tom
had
a
bright
idea
.

Keep
the
door
locked
.

I
thought
we
were
going
out
to
dinner
.

I
was
born
during
the
Cold War
.

It
seems
to
me
that
he
likes
music
.

She
is
much
younger
than
Tom
.

Tom
and
Mary
agreed
on
everything
.

Tom
did
n't
write
Mary
back
.

That
's
my
theory
.

She
looks
down
on
me
for
not
having
a
sense
of
humor
.

She
could
n't
keep
from
crying
.

"
Where
are
my
keys
?

"
"
They
are
in
my
handbag
.

"
It
was
n't
easy
for
him
to
keep
his
promise
.

There
lived
a
pretty
girl
in
the
village
.

You
lied
to
us
,
did
n't
you
?

The
new
document
system
is
worth
$
4,000
.

A
lot
of
back
problems
can
be
attributed
to
poor
sitting
posture
.

Can
you
help
Tom
?

It
's
more
fun
to
play
baseball
than
to
watch
it
.

Tom
got
off
at
the
next
bus
stop
.

What
a
jungle
!

At
home
,
we
only
speak
French
.

We
're
on
the
same
side
,
Tom
.

I
'm
really
glad
you
're
here
.

You
've
been
through
a
lot
,
have
n't
you
?

As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
have
no
objection
to
the
plan
.

I
wonder
who
the
people
I
saw
her
with
were
.

I
'm
not
sure
if
that
's
a
good
idea
.

Tom
is
not
playing
by
the
rules
.

Internet
is
very
slow
.

She
is
now
on
vacation
.

Whoever
is
born
in
Austria
,
is
an
Austrian
.

Tom
arrived
too
early
.

Tom
has
fallen
in
love
with
Mary
.

This
time
,
I
really
mean
it
.

He
never
speaks
of
the
accident
.

The
rooster
crows
at
sunrise
.

We
'd
better
hurry
.

I
do
n't
want
to
be
late
for
the
concert
.

They
relaxed
in
front
of
the
fire
.

Could
you
not
do
that
here
?

Do
you
really
want
to
know
what
happened
?

This
woman
definitely
knows
that
she
does
n't
know
what
she
wants
.

I
'll
do
it
myself
.

How
many
weeks
are
there
in
a
month
?

I
am
calling
from
Germany
.

Joe
was
pleased
at
the
thought
of
going
to
New York
.

Is
Boston
far
away
?

What
's
the
next
step
to
be
done
?

Tom
dreamed
of
her
often
.

I
would
like
to
give
him
a
present
for
his
birthday
.

Tom
does
n't
seem
to
have
any
self-confidence
.

Are
you
interested
in
art
?

Seize
the
moments
of
happiness
,
love
and
be
loved
!

That
is
the
only
reality
in
the
world
,
all
else
is
folly
.

It
is
the
one
thing
we
are
interested
in
here
.

They
want
to
change
the
law
.

It
's
strange
that
she
came
home
so
late
at
night
.

How
long
would
it
take
to
swim
across
the
river
?

I
was
distressed
to
see
Tom
so
un
happy
.

We
'll
have
to
come
back
.

When
do
you
work
?

This
is
too
good
to
be
true
.

We
do
n't
have
a
whole
lot
of
time
.

She
works
as
an
assistant
to
the
manager
.

What
are
you
trying
to
do
?

Turkey
did
not
qualify
in
this
year
's
World Cup
.

There
was
a
light
rain
yesterday
.

A
skull
shaped
asteroid
flew
by
the
Earth
on
Halloween
.

I
know
what
that
piece
of
paper
is
.

I
am
hearing
a
voice
.

You
said
she
was
kind
and
so
she
is
.

You
could
learn
a
lot
from
them
if
you
'd
only
listen
.

What
's
the
thirteenth
month
?

Mary
broke
up
with
me
.

This
glass
is
dirty
.

I
've
looked
everywhere
.

I
have
a
great
deal
to
do
.

We
saw
her
on
the
beach
.

My
children
have
to
stay
indoors
after
dark
.

Why
are
you
shouting
?

Where
did
we
leave
off
last
time
?

It
is
to
his
advantage
.

They
're
all
mine
.

I
feel
a
good
cry
coming
on
.

I
was
n't
quite
sure
what
to
say
.

May
I
take
your
order
?

Tom
accepted
the
invitation
.

College
graduates
earn
on
average
over
fifty
per cent
more
than
those
with
only
a
high-school
degree
.

Let
's
take
the
Intercity-Express
.

You
made
the
same
mistake
as
last
time
.

Come
to
Romania
again
.

Children
do
n't
grow
up
speaking
pidgin
languages
;
they
turn
them
into
real
languages
:
creoles
.

What
do
you
usually
eat
with
red wine
?

Being
sick
,
I
had
to
stay
home
.

We
've
received
thirteen
complaints
so
far
this
week
.

Tom
asked
Mary
not
to
wake
him
up
before
seven
.

She
really
looks
pretty
.

Tom
usually
shows
up
on
time
.

He
could
swim
fast
enough
to
pass
the
test
.

I
know
the
artist
who
painted
this
picture
.

I
do
n't
know
why
I
'm
here
.

I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
tomorrow
.

My
father
was
busy
.

I
need
someone
to
talk
to
.

Many
kiss
the
hand
they
wish
to
cut
off
.

Not
to
advance
is
to
go
back
.

He
's
ready
to
go
.

My
father
does
nothing
but
watch
TV
on
Sundays
.

The
baby
kept
crying
all
night
.

This
is
what
I
'm
paying
you
for
.

Are
you
studying
English
every
day
?

Fall
begins
in
October
.

I
have
to
use
the
dictionary
.

Tom
told
Mary
that
he
'd
go
to
Boston
in
October
.

I
had
my
thirtieth
birthday
last
week
.

Tokyo
seems
to
have
got
the
message
from
Washington
.

How
are
the
children
?

I
like
to
eat
watermelon
.

I
want
to
stay
.

He
himself
tried
it
.

The
chair
was
too
high
,
and
I
found
myself
with
my
legs
hanging
in
the
air
.

Tom
and
Mary
stopped
hugging
.

Christmas
is
coming
soon
.

I
'm
sick
of
being
sick
.

It
is
not
known
who
has
the
authority
in
this
matter
.

Many
could
not
hear
him
.

Tom
does
n't
like
girls
who
wear
a
lot
of
makeup
.

The
old
lady
has
been
rather
feeble
since
her
illness
.

Who
's
your
favorite
country
musician
?

I
almost
never
listen
to
the
radio
.

You
should
have
consulted
your
lawyer
.

Daddy
,
let
's
make
faces
at
each other
and
see
who
can
keep
from
laughing
the
longest
.

How
much
did
the
glasses
cost
?

Mary
is
as
tall
as
Tom
is
.

Tom
earns
three
times
as
much
as
me
.

She
must
be
mad
at
you
.

I
'll
be
back
at
six-thirty
.

I
think
he
's
telling
the
truth
.

How
are
you
doing
,
Tom
?

My
grandmother
passed
away
.

Eight
plus
two
is
ten
.

It
will
take
an
hour
to
get
there
.

How
's
married
life
going
?

This
shop
carries
men
's
clothing
.

Ah
...
maybe
tonight
...
Why
did
n't
you
stay
in
Germany
?

Tom
told
me
that
he
would
help
us
.

We
'll
go
on
a
picnic
next
Sunday
.

You
look
really
pale
.

Are
you
all right
?

I
want
you
to
return
to
your
seat
.

He
is
a
man
of
warm
heart
.

Somebody
's
at
the
front door
.

Tom
likes
to
stay
home
and
read
books
on
weekends
.

Tom
's
house
is
easy
to
find
.

We
must
be
imagining
things
.

I
do
n't
want
to
be
rich
.

The
police
are
checking
their
bags
.

Oh
,
would
you
catch
the
phone
for
me
,
please
?

I
think
you
know
why
I
ca
n't
do
that
.

A
hero
is
often
just
a
person
who
does
n't
have
the
ability
to
recognise
danger
.

A
stranger
came
into
the
building
.

I
wonder
what
's
wrong
.

That
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
.

Everybody
is
subject
to
law
.

He
had
huge
mood
swings
.

She
asked
for
a
picture
.

He
went
to
Paris
,
where
he
met
me
for
the
first
time
.

She
has
a
double-barrelled
name
.

Forget
the
anxieties
of
life
and
learn
to
relax
.

I
like
to
cut
up
wood
in
my
backyard
.

I
'm
17
,
too
.

Tom
left
for
home
well
over
an
hour
ago
.

She
crawled
out
of
bed
.

You
had
better
go
and
thank
her
in
person
.

Brian
gets
his
mother
to
do
his
homework
.

How
much
property
does
the
landlord
own
?

One
should
keep
one
's
promises
.

Tom
ca
n't
swim
very
well
yet
.

Tom
does
n't
look
happy
.

Is
this
your
bike
?

You
gave
Tom
the
money
he
asked
for
,
did
n't
you
?

I
do
n't
want
to
work
at
a
supermarket
all
my
life
.

We
've
run
short
of
oil
.

I
hear
voices
in
my
head
.

I
need
to
speak
to
you
about
something
.

Tom
is
never
going
to
give
up
trying
.

I
do
n't
see
anything
.

Tom
wanted
to
find
a
creative
way
to
tell
Mary
that
he
loved
her
.

Let
me
see
.

There
were
fifteen
people
.

Put
yourself
in
my
position
.

He
never
counts
on
my
help
.

The
rain
soaked
through
my
clothes
.

Maybe
she
likes
you
,
too
.

This
year
the
circus
has
ten
elephants
.

Tom
asked
me
to
go
with
Mary
.

Tom
loves
to
lie
in
the
grass
on
a
sunny
day
.

Tom
helped
Mary
steal
the
jewels
.

It
â€™s
the
first
time
that
I
read
the
Bible
.

There
is
trouble
brewing
.

We
were
as
one
in
our
opinion
.

Tom
is
sad
,
as
in
German
sentences
he
is
often
separated
from
Mary
by
a
comma
.

We
had
snow
this
morning
.

What
's
happening
here
?

The
rest
of
us
all
had
the
smoked
salmon
.

Why
did
n't
she
tell
me
?

Tom
is
as
tall
as
his
father
.

He
knows
a
lot
about
foreign
affairs
.

I
studied
Chinese
in
Beijing
.

Have
they
announced
the
court
's
decision
yet
?

I
arrived
in
London
.

The
plot
to
assassinate
the
president
was
discovered
just
in
time
.

I
want
to
buy
a
pair
of
ski
boots
.

Tom
told
me
to
wait
outside
.

It
looks
like
Mary
is
drunk
again
.

No
thanks
,
I
'm
pregnant
.

The
information
counts
for
much
to
us
.

I
have
five
copies
but
I
need
double
that
.

It
is
better
to
live
one
day
as
a
lion
than
100
years
as
a
sheep
.

He
has
started
acting
strangely
.

Mary
could
be
a
model
.

Neither
God
nor
Master
.

After
a
day
of
visiting
the
amusement
park
,
the
children
fell
asleep
on
the
car
ride
home
.

I
'm
ashamed
of
what
my
fellow
professionals
and
I
have
done
during
the
past
.

Is
that
why
you
called
me
?

Tom
has
a
Swiss
bank
account
.

I
've
been
to
the
mall
.

He
was
named
after
his
grandfather
.

I
gave
him
a
huge
hug
.

Tom
wanted
to
become
a
Canadian
citizen
.

I
wanted
to
help
Tom
understand
what
Mary
was
trying
to
tell
him
.

Have
you
told
Tom
what
to
buy
?

He
might
have
missed
the
last
train
.

Tom
thought
Mary
was
exaggerating
.

I
ca
n't
take
you
to
work
with
me
.

Iron
is
a
very
useful
metal
.

Wait
for
the
bread
to
completely
cool
down
before
eating
it
.

Tom
has
never
cheated
on
his
wife
.

It
is
the
secret
for
improving
one
self
.

I
've
been
stung
by
a
hornet
.

The
man
who
lives
next
to
Tom
is
quite
peculiar
.

May
I
see
that
blouse
,
please
?

In
the
distance
we
saw
the
island
.

These
letters
,
in
the
main
,
are
from
my
mother
.

It
is
n't
worthwhile
going
there
.

I
'd
hate
to
be
in
Tom
's
shoes
.

"
What
's
the
reason
for
your
allergy
this
time
?

Is
it
the
olive
oil
in
the
salad
?

"
"
No
,
it
's
the
tomatoes
.

"
What
's
your
favorite
commercial
?

I
believe
him
to
be
intelligent
.

How
long
has
he
lived
in
London
?

Life
is
too
short
to
seek
perfection
in
material
things
.

I
would
like
to
try
the
blue
striped
skirt
.

That
's
discouraging
.

How
many
guests
did
you
invite
?

Tom
almost
never
makes
a
mistake
.

Tom
lowered
the
bucket
into
the
well
.

He
's
the
oldest
son
.

After
we
had
eaten
,
we
went
outside
to
skate
.

Tom
never
would
've
done
this
.

You
're
doing
it
on
purpose
!

I
know
not
with
what
weapons
World War III
will
be
fought
,
but
World War IV
will
be
fought
with
sticks
and
stones
.

I
'm
afraid
that
she
'll
refuse
my
request
.

Has
Tom
ever
eaten
at
this
restaurant
?

You
should
apologize
to
Dad
for
not
coming
home
in
time
for
supper
.

He
reached
for
the
pistol
.

Many
a
man
believes
the
story
.

She
's
a
good
actress
and
she
's
really
pretty
.

Sally
is
two
years
older
than
Ken
.

Tom
and
Mary
are
planning
to
have
a
house
built
after
they
have
their
first
child
.

This
is
just
the
type
of
car
I
want
.

At
school
,
I
've
learned
to
write
Latin
.

Catholics
are
against
birth
control
.

I
will
remove
the
labels
tagging
the
above
sentences
.

He
was
compelled
to
sign
the
contract
.

There
were
a
lot
of
people
at
Tom
's
funeral
.

You
do
n't
speak
French
,
do
you
?

Some
families
spend
their
vacation
near
the
beach
.

Stop
being
so
bull-headed
!

I
took
a
bus
so
I
would
n't
be
late
for
my
appointment
.

Do
n't
be
so
greedy
.

The
first
thing
you
should
do
is
call
a
lawyer
.

Tom
lived
in
an
interesting
part
of
Boston
.

"
Thank
you
,
I
'd
love
to
have
another
piece
of
cake
,
"
said
the
shy
young
man
.

It
's
nice
that
Tom
finally
has
a
hobby
.

Native
French
speakers
often
add
spaces
before
punctuation
in
other
languages
even
though
it
is
usually
incorrect
.

I
could
make
myself
understood
in
English
.

Where
's
today
's
newspaper
?

Had
he
been
there
,
would
you
have
wanted
to
come
?

He
puts
a
lot
of
thought
into
how
he
thinks
.

Tom
is
taking
care
of
it
for
us
.

Tom
ca
n't
see
Mary
from
where
he
is
.

Do
what
you
think
is
best
.

Tom
looks
disoriented
.

Did
you
call
him
yet
?

Today
is
going
to
be
a
good
day
!

You
're
the
only
person
that
can
persuade
him
.

Adjust
the
microscope
's
focus
.

I
remember
that
.

If
the
text
does
n't
make
sense
,
it
is
n't
coherent
.

Where
's
Mary
's
ring
?

The
modern
,
rational
,
logical
and
unprejudiced
science
has
already
given
us
far
more
secure
knowledge
and
immeasurably
more
than
any
religion
has
ever
given
us
.

Tom
is
wearing
his
coat
.

Where
did
you
get
that
tan
?

These
Chinese
characters
are
not
too
difficult
for
us
.

That
man
over
there
is
Pedro
.

He
wants
to
get
married
right
away
.

I
ca
n't
keep
doing
this
.

He
lived
abroad
for
many
years
.

Thou
shalt
love
the
country
in
which
thou
wast
born
.

Do
you
have
anyone
on
your
staff
who
can
speak
French
?

Put
that
box
down
.

I
have
to
go
shopping
;
I
'll
be
back
in
an
hour
.

As
Ï€
is
transcendental
,
the
quadrature
of
a
circle
-
a
classical
problem
in
geometry
-
is
im
possible
.

I
really
should
have
called
.

I
've
done
everything
Tom
asked
me
to
do
.

The
only
place
Tom
has
ever
wanted
to
live
is
Boston
.

I
'm
worried
about
what
'll
happen
if
Tom
comes
.

How
do
you
pronounce
that
?

How
does
he
do
this
?

This
mustard
really
bites
the
tongue
.

She
almost
fainted
.

I
heard
Tom
speak
French
yesterday
for
the
first
time
.

It
ca
n't
possibly
work
.

I
took
the
children
to
school
.

Many
a
man
has
predicted
it
.

I
want
to
learn
Korean
.

Do
you
speak
Albanian
?

I
know
her
by
name
,
but
not
by
sight
.

My
father
is
out
in
the
garden
now
.

Is
there
any
chance
of
my
borrowing
your
typewriter
?

When
she
heard
the
news
,
she
sighed
disappointedly
.

I
miss
you
guys
so
much
!

Those
two
really
hit
it
off
.

Tom
helped
Mary
up
the
stairs
.

We
do
n't
know
when
this
world
came
into
being
.

Go
down
this
road
until
you
get
to
a
traffic light
and
then
turn
left
.

We
spoke
of
several
issues
.

Tom
comes
here
every
other
week
.

Tom
sort
of
took
me
under
his
wing
.

Tom
looks
busy
today
.

Aiding
and
abetting
the
enemy
is
considered
treason
.

Defenestrate
your
clock
to
see
how
time
flies
.

Not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
on
the
street
.

The
office
was
small
but
it
had
a
view
of
the
city
.

You
do
n't
have
to
tell
that
to
your
parents
.

I
ca
n't
believe
it
.

The
criminal
is
sure
to
do
time
for
robbing
the
store
.

It
's
not
over
yet
.

Sachiko
is
more
popular
than
Judy
.

Both
roads
lead
to
the
station
.

We
have
enough
money
.

Do
you
take
travelers
'
checks
?

I
have
a
bad
cold
.

Watch
attentively
.

I
'll
show
you
how
it
's
done
.

It
was
a
mistake
to
break
up
with
you
.

You
know
enough
.

The
tribe
worships
its
ancestors
and
speaks
its
own
language
,
and
speaks
an
unfamiliar
language
.

It
was
raining
on
and
off
all
night
long
.

Because
I
speak
Chinese
.

There
's
something
important
I
need
to
tell
her
.

You
are
welcome
here
!

Why
are
thoughts
so
hard
to
describe
.

Tom
smelled
something
.

Do
you
get
me
?

She
asked
about
the
location
of
the
house
.

I
thought
you
'd
quit
smoking
.

Mary
had
a
little
lamb
,
whose
fleece
was
white
as
snow
.

I
have
forgiven
him
already
.

I
never
heard
anything
like
that
.

Tom
told
Mary
he
was
n't
interested
in
discussing
his
problems
with
her
.

It
sounds
as
if
he
were
to
blame
for
the
disaster
.

He
has
made
the
company
what
it
is
today
.

Dan
did
n't
use
a
mobile
.

He
said
that
he
takes
a
walk
in
the
park
every
morning
.

I
do
n't
want
Tom
to
know
about
this
.

I
feel
so
alone
.

I
think
we
could
be
great
friends
.

According
to
some
sources
,
Noam Chomsky
is
the
most
cited
living
author
.

Have
any
of
you
seen
Tom
?

What
's
the
right
spirit
to
adopt
when
learning
a
language
?

Marble
floors
are
beautiful
.

It
sounds
strange
,
but
it
is
true
none
the
less
.

The
only
way
I
can
eat
oatmeal
is
with
a
lot
of
sugar
.

Maybe
we
could
collaborate
.

Let
's
get
Tom
something
useful
for
Christmas
.

I
hate
shopping
.

I
hope
I
'll
see
you
again
soon
.

He
pretends
not
to
care
about
money
.

Whoever
you
vote
for
,
prices
will
go
on
rising
.

Ooh
!

Chocolate
mousse
.

Yummy
.

Music
is
a
part
of
me
.

Do
n't
forget
to
mail
this
letter
first
thing
in
the
morning
.

The
hooligans
have
been
banned
from
matches
.

Tom
wanted
to
talk
with
you
.

Guys
,
we
need
to
talk
.

I
've
been
trying
to
avoid
her
.

The
tar
wo
n't
come
off
.

I
'm
going
to
have
to
take
this
skirt
to
the
dry
cleaner
.

Tom
takes
a
shower
every
morning
before
breakfast
.

I
was
n't
conscious
of
anyone
watching
me
.

It
's
been
delivered
.

This
is
a
map
of
the
city
of
Sendai
.

Never
choose
a
vocation
just
because
it
looks
profitable
.

Tom
,
I
still
love
you
very
much
.

"
Do
you
like
snakes
?

"
"
Of course
not
.

"
My
sister
is
engaged
in
social
work
.

I
thought
Tom
was
Mary
's
son
.

Does
Tom
believe
in
magic
?

What
do
I
look
like
?

There
is
the
train
at
10 o'clock
.

Climate change
is
real
and
it
's
caused
by
humans
.

The
children
are
bouncing
on
the
trampoline
.

His
eyes
shone
as
bright
as
stars
,
and
his
hair
,
although
dripping
with
water
,
curled
in
beautiful
ringlets
.

This
is
n't
love
.

That
was
years
ago
.

Tom
says
he
does
n't
know
any
French
.

Tom
changed
a
few
words
on
the
report
and
resubmitted
it
.

My
first
impression
was
that
he
was
a
tactful
politician
.

The
word
came
to
be
used
for
all
small
heavenly
bodies
revolving
about
larger
ones
.

We
know
this
.

We
're
very
happy
with
the
results
.

I
'm
really
fed
up
with
this
heat
.

I
have
to
go
to
the
toilet
.

I
wish
I
could
join
you
.

That
dog
tries
to
eat
just
about
anything
he
lays
his
eyes
on
.

It
was
n't
so
bad
.

It
's
amazing
how
much
he
can
stand
.

My
taste
is
quite
different
from
yours
.

He
has
no
more
than
one hundred
books
.

You
are
the
tallest
one
.

Tired
of
reading
,
she
took
a
nap
.

I
'm
not
saying
what
she
did
was
the
right
thing
to
do
.

Do
n't
worry
about
such
a
silly
thing
.

Tom
called
Mary
over
to
ask
her
what
she
thought
of
the
tie
he
was
thinking
of
buying
.

Stock
prices
plunged
to
a
record
low
.

A
lot
of
insects
are
chirping
in
the
field
.

We
ca
n't
leave
Tom
here
.

Put
pressure
on
the
wound
to
stop
the
bleeding
.

Young
people
have
new
ideas
very
often
.

The
Cannes International Film Festival
is
the
most
prestigious
film
festival
in
the
world
.

French
is
taught
by
Mr
White
,
not
by
Miss
Green
.

When
was
the
last
time
you
played
violin
?

Tom
plays
the
cello
with
one
of
the
local
orchestras
.

I
doubt
Tom
would
agree
.

We
have
to
move
.

You
think
I
did
it
,
do
n't
you
?

I
do
n't
know
anything
about
their
relationship
.

I
'm
doing
this
for
my
family
.

Of
your
two
suggestions
,
I
think
I
prefer
the
former
.

On
hearing
the
news
,
he
shouted
with
joy
.

Have
you
seen
Tom
yet
?

He
fell
under
the
suspicion
of
the
police
.

A
human
body
consists
of
a
countless
number
of
cells
.

I
'm
beginning
to
understand
why
Tom
loves
Boston
.

This
is
one
of
the
worst
movies
that
I
have
ever
seen
.

I
have
enough
money
to
buy
a
car
.

Are
you
sane
?

Can
it
be
that
a
white
horse
is
not
a
horse
?

Tom
usually
gives
good
advice
.

Let
me
introduce
my
sister
to
you
.

The
baby
fell
into
the
well
.

She
glows
with
happiness
.

Men
never
cry
.

Is
that
all
Tom
told
you
?

Do
you
have
the
source
code
?

You
've
put
on
weight
.

Ben
loves
his
sister
.

The
children
started
bouncing
up
and
down
on
the
couch
.

How
long
is
the
flight
from
Tokyo
to
Hawaii
?

Mary
spoke
Japanese
slowly
.

What
do
you
call
this
animal
in
French
?

This
is
what
I
like
about
him
.

Who
told
Tom
that
?

I
do
n't
know
when
you
must
turn
off
the
device
.

Tom
does
n't
have
a
house
to
live
in
.

We
have
to
leave
.

Within
one
day
,
they
were
in
France
.

Working
in
the
garden
is
a
struggle
nature
is
eventually
going
to
win
.

The
sun
has
just
sunk
below
the
horizon
.

I
never
got
a
chance
to
say
goodbye
to
Tom
.

How
about
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
?

The
airplane
is
capable
of
supersonic
speeds
.

Last
night
there
was
a
full
moon
.

Why
does
n't
Tom
know
that
?

Something
is
flashing
up
ahead
.

I
do
n't
know
when
I
can
get
away
.

Please
get
out
of
here
immediately
.

He
is
not
an
American
,
but
he
loves
America
.

As
it
got
warmer
,
I
took
off
the
sweater
.

What
am
I
supposed
to
be
looking
for
?

Tom
was
surprised
how
easy
it
was
to
do
.

May
I
have
your
name
?

We
closed
early
.

The
main
reason
kids
tell
lies
is
to
avoid
getting
into
trouble
.

I
think
it
's
time
to
wind
up
this
meeting
.

We
will
have
a
period
of
orientation
for
freshmen
.

What
does
that
word
mean
?

It
is
conceivable
that
he
knows
the
rumor
.

Tom
looked
as
if
he
'd
seen
a
ghost
.

He
advised
her
to
stop
drinking
.

Tom
is
waiting
to
see
how
things
will
develop
.

He
is
bound
to
win
the
match
.

That
's
not
what
I
was
looking
for
.

They
had
no
alternative
energy
sources
.

Five
of
them
attacked
me
,
but
I
overcame
them
all
.

Bad
news
travels
quickly
.

When
can
one
say
that
a
person
has
alcohol
issues
?

Peace
has
returned
after
three
years
of
war
.

I
do
n't
want
anyone
to
take
notes
!

I
ca
n't
believe
I
'm
sitting
next
to
Mary
.

When
I
told
him
that
,
he
was
very
much
embarrassed
.

Tom
rushed
into
his
office
and
slammed
the
door
.

He
called
his
mother
up
from
the
airport
.

There
are
over
800,000
Basque
speakers
in
the
world
.

I
went
to
Kobe
,
where
I
first
met
her
.

We
arrived
at
a
hotel
in
Rome
.

Though
he
lives
within
a
stone
's
throw
of
the
school
,
he
is
often
late
.

He
's
never
been
better
.

Tom
's
a
jerk
.

He
writes
letters
to
his
mother
.

I
was
expelled
from
school
.

Japanese
flags
were
flying
.

Honesty
is
n't
always
the
best
policy
.

Mary
is
working
as
a
model
.

Can
I
call
you
Eli
?

The
room
is
very
cold
.

The
fire
has
gone
out
.

Now
,
do
n't
panic
.

He
has
read
War and Peace
15
times
.

Your
beauty
turns
me
pale
.

My
father
stretched
after
dinner
.

We
have
small
and
large
portions
.

I
teach
geography
.

That
gives
me
hope
.

That
must
have
hurt
!

You
knew
this
was
going
to
happen
,
right
?

Close
the
window
before
you
leave
.

The
chairman
of
the
meeting
became
ill
.

Her
career
had
hit
its
nadir
.

Little
did
she
know
that
things
would
soon
improve
.

They
were
listening
to
the
lecture
attentively
.

My
taxi
should
be
here
soon
.

They
seemed
to
be
discussing
a
matter
of
great
importance
.

I
do
n't
want
that
to
happen
.

Do
you
approve
of
what
she
is
doing
?

They
all
have
one
thing
in
common
.

Tom
is
extremely
fit
.

Last
week
,
I
mailed
him
some
souvenirs
from
the
U.S.
Tom
knew
Mary
would
arrive
late
.

You
need
to
become
more
active
.

We
'd
better
go
home
now
.

She
wrote
to
him
to
tell
him
that
she
could
n't
come
to
visit
next
summer
.

I
think
that
Mary
is
trying
to
seduce
Tom
.

The
more
you
read
,
the
more
you
know
.

That
whoever
believes
in
him
shall
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
.

How
many
rooms
do
you
have
?

He
's
shorter
than
his
father
.

It
looks
different
.

This
is
the
pen
that
he
signed
the
document
with
.

Can
I
leave
my
luggage
here
?

There
seem
to
be
several
reasons
for
his
failure
.

He
is
trying
to
fool
people
into
thinking
that
I
think
things
that
I
do
nâ€™t
.

This
summer
resort
is
no
longer
as
popular
as
it
used
to
be
.

Ca
n't
you
ride
a
bicycle
?

Your
method
is
different
from
mine
.

I
have
revenge
for
breakfast
,
lunch
,
and
dinner
.

You
changed
a
lot
.

Emily
is
crying
.

I
'm
against
it
.

Old
age
has
undermined
her
memory
.

Do
you
have
another
opinion
?

Would
you
like
to
play
a
game
of
Japanese
chess
?

I
love
to
play
my
guitar
.

This
train
leaves
at
nine o'clock
.

Me
?

Encourage
you
to
work
?

Blasphemy
!

He
learns
Portuguese
in
Brazil
.

You
are
very
rich
.

I
love
my
Italian
dialect
.

I
'm
all
alone
now
.

Tom
changed
jobs
.

Tom
and
Mary
split
up
after
being
married
for
three
years
.

The
cost
of
petrol
keeps
on
going
up
.

I
hate
to
write
big
numbers
.

I
hear
the
grass
is
green
even
in
the
winter
in
England
.

Today
,
many
problems
were
encountered
.

Although
Tom
is
sick
,
he
's
planning
on
going
to
school
.

Do
abbots
mow
hay
?

Abbots
never
mow
hay
.

Abbots
pray
!

Have
you
met
my
sister
?

I
'm
getting
tired
of
losing
.

Most
people
expected
John Adams
to
win
.

He
returned
to
his
native
village
,
where
he
spent
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
.

He
translated
the
book
from
French
into
English
.

I
have
been
to
America
twice
.

You
have
no
clue
what
you
are
doing
,
do
you
?

Can
you
trust
Tom
?

I
hate
the
world
because
the
world
hates
me
.

Detached
reflection
can
not
be
demanded
in
the
presence
of
an
uplifted
knife
.

I
'm
convinced
that
my
daughter
will
pass
the
exam
.

I
often
use
SSH
to
access
my
computers
remotely
.

Caution
!

Wet
Paint
Does
Tom
get
migraines
often
?

She
's
elegant
and
refined
.

They
found
what
they
were
looking
for
.

The
apple tree
has
a
beautiful
blossom
.

But
people
have
little
hope
.

My
bedroom
is
crawling
with
spiders
.

All right
,
I
'm
outta
here
.

Tom
is
very
polite
.

This
train
gets
to
Chicago
at
9 o'clock
tonight
.

Our
plan
will
call
for
a
lot
of
money
.

Will
this
dictionary
do
?

It
has
been
found
that
smoking
is
bad
for
your
health
.

Let
's
check
.

She
came
around
to
my
house
.

They
are
waiting
for
you
in
front
of
the
door
.

I
could
reply
to
all
of
them
.

It
smells
bad
.

We
'll
check
on
it
right
now
.

At
my
sister
's
.

We
had
better
begin
to
prepare
for
the
test
.

You
should
probably
tell
Tom
you
do
n't
want
to
do
that
.

Do
you
want
to
get
married
?

A
software
engineer
writes
computer
programs
.

There
are
plenty
of
fish
in
this
river
.

Madlene
's
voice
is
very
good
.

Can
Tom
speak
French
?

I
'm
teaching
Basque
.

By the way
,
did
you
find
the
umbrella
you
said
you
'd
lost
the
other
day
?

I
'm
sick
of
listening
to
your
complaints
.

Are
you
blowing
me
off
?

Whoever
does
n't
capitalize
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself
will
later
regret
not
having
used
the
chance
.

Throw
a
tear-gas
bomb
at
him
.

The
station
is
a
ten
minute
drive
from
here
.

We
'll
have
to
be
careful
not
to
play
into
his
hands
.

Why
is
my
memory
so
bad
?

I
'm
always
forgetting
things
!

If
you
do
n't
give
in
now
,
you
will
regret
it
later
.

Could
you
leave
us
alone
?

What
's
Tom
doing
now
?

The
doctor
told
Tom
that
he
should
eat
a
lot
of
vegetables
.

He
saw
a
small
Band-Aid
on
her
left
knee
.

The
Mayor
addressed
a
large
audience
.

I
was
n't
worried
.

I
'm
glad
I
do
n't
have
to
do
that
anymore
.

No
one
expected
them
to
win
.

Tom
needs
to
leave
early
today
.

I
have
no
objection
to
your
plan
.

Both
of
those
students
did
n't
pass
the
test
.

This
is
the
book
that
I
told
you
about
.

Tom
used
to
write
songs
.

A
MaÃŸ
is
a
beer
mug
that
contains
1
litre
of
beer
.

Tom
hardly
ever
talks
to
Mary
.

Why
do
people
do
such
stupid
things
?

Tom
is
looking
for
someone
.

Stay
here
with
her
.

They
even
named
their
boy
after
you
.

Tom
quickly
opened
the
letter
.

You
need
to
leave
right
now
.

I
miss
Italy
.

I
always
admired
her
openly
.

How
much
time
has
passed
?

Are
you
going
to
call
Tom
?

I
do
n't
really
care
who
wins
.

I
knew
as
little
about
his
past
as
I
did
about
my
parents
'
.

Does
this
make
any
sense
to
you
?

He
likes
to
spend
some
time
in
solitude
every
day
.

The
suit
's
made
of
very
rough
material
.

My
wife
is
mad
.

He
's
from
a
foreign
country
.

What
's
the
best
way
to
travel
?

Do
you
like
school
?

Sorry
about
the
last
time
.

I
'm
sorry
to
call
you
this
late
at
night
,
but
I
really
needed
someone
to
talk
to
.

I
do
n't
want
to
go
out
with
Tom
.

They
're
all
dead
.

Tom
made
that
mistake
on
purpose
.

We
've
got
to
go
and
help
Tom
.

Where
is
the
source
of
this
river
?

We
like
to
fight
.

Have
you
ever
seen
a
purple
butterfly
?

Choose
the
color
you
like
the
best
.

Now
,
it
's
time
to
celebrate
.

I
'm
buying
my
watch
in
that
shop
there
.

Has
Tom
had
any
visitors
?

He
's
too
old
.

The
apple tree
,
which
the
two
children
had
planted
,
grew
year
after
year
,
till
it
became
so
large
that
it
had
to
be
transplanted
into
the
garden
.

I
did
not
mean
to
disappoint
her
.

I
can
not
mock
Ken
.

He
's
my
brother
.

Are
those
yours
?

I
once
knew
a
guy
who
claimed
to
feel
a
spiritual
bond
with
stoats
.

Weirdo
.

If
he
is
innocent
,
it
follows
that
his
wife
is
guilty
.

The
natives
collect
and
store
rain-water
to
drink
.

On
the
contrary
,
I
've
never
said
such
a
thing
.

He
stood
up
and
took
a
deep
breath
.

I
saw
him
off
at
the
airport
.

Wine
makes
glad
the
heart
of
man
.

Tom
does
n't
understand
French
.

The
scholarship
gave
me
a
chance
to
continue
my
studies
.

My
work
is
very
important
.

Malcom
killed
Tom
because
he
was
tired
of
seeing
his
name
in
lots
of
sentences
.

Here
we
are
finally
at
the
airport
.

Are
you
seeing
a
man
?

He
is
a
painter
.

There
is
a
very
strict
rule
forbidding
smoking
in
bed
.

Tom
's
eyes
are
red
,
and
he
looks
very
tired
.

Would
you
speak
more
slowly
?

You
find
that
it
is
shaped
by
science
.

It
's
one
of
my
favorite
movies
.

Tom
handed
Mary
a
glass
of
red wine
.

Tom
and
Mary
did
n't
know
.

You
are
imagining
things
.

We
rent
the
flat
.

She
fell
asleep
on
the
bus
.

This
book
is
written
in
easy
English
.

Tom
asked
Mary
where
he
should
put
his
suitcase
.

Jupiter
and
Saturn
are
gas
giants
.

I
do
know
that
.

There
are
many
birds
in
this
park
.

Is
n't
it
Tuesday
?

Tell
Tom
I
'll
call
him
back
.

The
portrait
had
a
dark
background
.

Emily
is
afraid
of
heights
.

Tell
Tom
I
'm
innocent
.

They
are
just
waiting
for
the
storm
to
pass
.

I
stood
aside
to
let
them
pass
.

Whatever
he
said
,
it
's
not
true
.

It
's
estimated
that
,
over
our
lifetime
,
we
spend
up
to
six
months
standing
in
queues
.

Who
made
these
rules
?

A
lot
of
wild
animals
died
for
lack
of
food
.

Osakans
sometimes
roll
their
Rs
like
in
Spanish
.

I
'm
sorry
,
but
it
's
no
longer
available
.

Tom
is
thinking
of
going
to
Boston
next
spring
.

It
's
not
written
in
French
.

A
grasshopper
and
many
ants
lived
in
a
field
.

I
could
n't
have
done
it
without
you
.

Thank
you
.

Do
you
think
I
'm
ugly
?

I
have
not
heard
from
her
recently
.

Tom
is
outside
playing
with
his
friends
.

Did
you
hear
about
Tom
's
plans
for
the
weekend
?

Tom
opened
the
glove
compartment
and
took
out
a
pair
of
sunglasses
.

What
's
the
minimum
salary
in
the
United States
?

His
wife
begged
him
not
to
run
any
risk
.

Tom
's
your
father
.

Who
's
your
favorite
celebrity
?

Good
luck
convincing
him
.

I
must
have
misunderstood
.

She
has
to
go
shopping
in
the
afternoon
.

When
your
stomach
is
busy
,
digesting
a
big
meal
your
brain
takes
a
vacation
.

It
's
a
crime
against
nature
.

I
did
n't
murder
anyone
.

I
knew
his
intentions
right
at
the
beginning
.

Yesterday
I
saw
a
girl
whom
I
had
met
in
the
library
a
month
before
.

She
took
no
notice
of
what
her
father
said
.

My
special
branch
of
study
is
sociology
.

She
guided
her
business
to
success
.

Some
people
quarrel
for
no
reason
at all
.

He
got
fired
for
making
waves
too
often
.

Tom
thought
Mary
was
wasting
her
time
.

I
like
the
picture
that
I
see
there
.

He
is
the
last
person
to
betray
his
friends
.

I
hate
so-called
"
30
days
"
language
courses
.

I
have
immunity
.

We
have
a
wide
choice
of
fruits
at
the
supermarket
.

I
think
Tom
is
sane
.

I
've
never
been
this
busy
before
.

He
left
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
.

This
computer
has
a
Pentium
microprocessor
.

I
am
dead
tired
.

I
have
already
eaten
lunch
.

I
have
once
seen
a
live
whale
.

Tom
is
the
only
one
who
can
help
you
do
that
.

Oh
my
God
!

Tom
looked
at
me
!

He
took
his
time
doing
his
homework
.

Had
I
known
that
you
would
be
so
happy
about
this
bike
,
I
would
have
gotten
you
one
much
earlier
!

What
did
Shakespeare
write
?

Tom
does
n't
like
you
very
much
either
.

The
soldier
lay
dying
.

Perhaps
you
'd
be
willing
to
volunteer
.

I
told
Tom
he
should
n't
drink
that
.

What
are
you
drinking
?

Tom
is
waiting
for
Mary
's
reply
.

I
love
thick
,
creamy
mushroom
soup
.

I
hope
you
wo
n't
expect
results
immediately
.

Does
this
cap
belong
to
you
?

Did
anyone
come
in
my
absence
?

There
are
days
where
I
feel
like
my
brain
wants
to
abandon
me
.

I
need
to
add
money
to
my
account

Does
she
have
a
big
nose
?

They
are
on
the
border
of
starvation
.

Luck
is
against
me
.

There
was
no
one
in
the
room
besides
Tom
and
Mary
.

Tom
rubbed
the
stone
that
the
good
fairy
had
given
him
,
whereupon
he
turned
into
a
squirrel
and
could
escape
to
freedom
through
the
bars
of
the
prison
window
with
ease
.

How
could
I
ever
trust
you
?

One
of
my
friends
wants
to
move
in
with
me
.

What
should
we
do
if
he
happens
to
come
late
?

If
I
act
weird
around
you
,
it
means
I
'm
comfortable
with
you
.

Tom
took
a
flower
out
of
the
vase
while
no
one
was
looking
.

The
storm
caused
a
lot
of
damage
to
the
crop
.

They
hate
each other
from
the
bottoms
of
their
hearts
.

It
is
n't
so
hot
today
.

We
do
nâ€™t
mean
to
talk
shop
.

How
long
are
you
going
to
stay
in
Oxford
?

I
blush
to
think
of
such
conduct
.

Tom
ca
n't
give
you
an
answer
now
.

She
has
a
fair
skin
and
hair
.

Most
guitars
have
six
strings
.

My
orders
are
to
go
with
you
.

It
's
sad
now
.

Tom
has
not
yet
arrived
.

Would
you
like
to
see
my
stamp
collection
?

I
do
n't
want
to
offend
you
.

Mary
is
kind
of
cute
.

I
need
to
buy
new
skis
.

It
's
a
fake
.

He
never
says
thanks
in
spite
of
all
that
I
've
done
for
him
.

John
has
confidence
in
his
ability
.

I
heard
screaming
.

There
is
a
kite
flying
above
the
tree
.

We
are
both
her
girlfriends
.

There
is
a
limit
to
everything
.

You
are
American
.

I
want
to
have
a
sword
!

I
want
you
to
come
with
me
to
see
Tom
.

He
and
I
are
bosom
friends
.

Do
n't
leave
me
here
alone
.

Tom
looked
pretty
distracted
.

I
was
about
to
ask
you
the
same
thing
.

They
went
to
New Zealand
.

You
have
to
acquire
as
soon
as
possible
a
good
knowledge
of
business
English
.

They
did
not
have
time
to
search
for
it
.

This
work
's
very
accurately
done
.

Tom
babysat
John
and
Mary
's
children
yesterday
evening

In
your
position
,
I
'd
probably
have
done
the
same
thing

I

Hardening
Brazil
â€™s
Soft
Power
BRASILIA
â€“
It
is
,
perhaps
,
a
truism
for
Brazil
â€™s
citizens
that
their
country
is
and
always
will
be
a
peaceful
one
.

After
all
,
Brazil
has
lived
with
its
ten
neighbors
without
conflict
for
almost
150
years
,
having
settled
its
borders
through
negotiation
.

It
last
went
to
war
in
1942
,
after
direct
aggression
by
Nazi
U-boats
in
the
South Atlantic
.

It
has
forsworn
nuclear weapons
,
having
signed
a
comprehensive
nuclear-safeguards
agreement
with
Argentina
and
the
International Atomic Energy Agency
.

Through
the
Common Market of the South
(
Mercosur
)
and
the
Union of South American Nations
(
Unasur
)
,
Brazil
is
helping
to
integrate
the
region
politically
,
economically
,
socially
,
and
culturally
.

But
is
soft
power
enough
for
one
of
the
world
â€™s
major
emerging
countries
?

To
be
sure
,
Brazil
â€™s
peaceful
foreign policy
has
served
it
well
.

Brazil
has
used
its
stature
to
advance
peace
and
cooperation
in
South America
and
beyond
.

Its
constructive
stance
derives
from
a
worldview
that
accords
pride
of
place
to
the
values
of
democracy
,
social
justice
,
economic
development
,
and
environmental
protection
.

Brazil
â€™s
unique
approach
to
promoting
these
ideals
is
an
important
source
of
its
soft
power
,
reflected
in
the
broad
international
support
that
placed
Brazilians
atop
international
institutions
like
the
Food and Agriculture Organization
and
the
World Trade Organization
.

Yet
no
country
can
rely
on
soft
power
alone
to
defend
its
interests
.

Indeed
,
in
an
unpredictable
world
,
where
old
threats
are
compounded
by
new
challenges
,
policymakers
can
not
disregard
hard
power
.

By
deterring
threats
to
national
sovereignty
,
military
power
supports
peace
;
and
,
in
Brazil
â€™s
case
,
it
underpins
our
country
â€™s
constructive
role
in
the
pursuit
of
global
stability
.

That
role
is
more
necessary
than
ever
.

Over
the
past
two
decades
,
unilateral
actions
in
disregard
of
the
UN Security Council
â€™s
primary
responsibility
in
matters
of
war
and
peace
have
led
to
greater
uncertainty
and
instability
.

After
Austerity
NEW YORK
â€“
This
year
â€™s
annual
meeting
of
the
International Monetary Fund
made
clear
that
Europe
and
the
international
community
remain
rudderless
when
it
comes
to
economic
policy
.

Financial
leaders
,
from
finance ministers
to
leaders
of
private
financial institutions
,
reiterated
the
current
mantra
:
the
crisis
countries
have
to
get
their
houses
in
order
,
reduce
their
deficits
,
bring
down
their
national
debts
,
undertake
structural
reforms
,
and
promote
growth
.

Confidence
,
it
was
repeatedly
said
,
needs
to
be
restored
.

It
is
a
little
precious
to
hear
such
pontifications
from
those
who
,
at
the
helm
of
central banks
,
finance
ministries
,
and
private
banks
,
steered
the
global
financial
system
to
the
brink
of
ruin
â€“
and
created
the
ongoing
mess
.

Worse
,
seldom
is
it
explained
how
to
square
the
circle
.

How
can
confidence
be
restored
as
the
crisis
economies
plunge
into
recession
?

How
can
growth
be
revived
when
austerity
will
almost
surely
mean
a
further
decrease
in
aggregate
demand
,
sending
output
and
employment
even
lower
?

This
we
should
know
by
now
:
markets
on
their
own
are
not
stable
.

Not
only
do
they
repeatedly
generate
destabilizing
asset
bubbles
,
but
,
when
demand
weakens
,
forces
that
exacerbate
the
downturn
come
into
play
.

Unemployment
,
and
fear
that
it
will
spread
,
drives
down
wages
,
incomes
,
and
consumption
â€“
and
thus
total
demand
.

Decreased
rates
of
household
formation
â€“
young
Americans
,
for
example
,
are
increasingly
moving
back
in
with
their
parents
â€“
depress
housing
prices
,
leading
to
still
more
foreclosures
.

States
with
balanced-budget
frameworks
are
forced
to
cut
spending
as
tax
revenues
fall
â€“
an
automatic
destabilizer
that
Europe
seems
mindlessly
bent
on
adopting
.

There
are
alternative
strategies
.

Some
countries
,
like
Germany
,
have
room
for
fiscal
maneuver
.

Using
it
for
investment
would
enhance
long-term
growth
,
with
positive
spillovers
to
the
rest
of
Europe
.

Angela Merkel
â€™s
Vision
Thing
CAMBRIDGE
â€“
As
Europe
struggles
to
save
the
euro
,
the
chorus
of
complaints
about
weak
leadership
in
the
world
â€™s
major
economies
grows
louder
.

Many
have
singled
out
German
Chancellor
Angela Merkel
for
failing
to
promote
a
vision
of
Europe
similar
to
that
of
her
predecessor
and
mentor
,
Helmut Kohl
.

Are
the
critics
right
?

Part
of
what
effective
leaders
do
is
communicate
a
vision
that
gives
meaning
to
policies
and
inspires
others
to
support
these
policies
(
and
those
who
propose
them
)
.

It
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
leaders
help
to
create
shared
objectives
and
energize
common
action
.

Usually
,
such
a
vision
provides
a
scenario
for
the
future
that
is
meant
to
encourage
change
,
though
it
may
also
portray
the
status
quo
â€“
or
the
past
â€“
as
attractive
,
thereby
encouraging
resistance
to
change
.

Either
way
,
without
a
vision
,
it
is
difficult
to
lead
others
anywhere
.

Frederick Smith
,
CEO
of
Federal Express
,
has
argued
that
â€œ
the
primary
task
of
leadership
is
to
communicate
the
vision
and
values
of
an
organization
.

But
one
must
be
cautious
about
visions
.

Sometimes
leaders
think
that
vision
can
solve
most
of
their
problems
,
but
th
China
and
a
New Balance
of
Power
SHANGHAI
â€“
The
last
rival
superpower
to
the
United States
,
the
Soviet Union
,
collapsed
in
1991
.

But
,
apart
from
its
military
strength
,
the
USSR
was
never
really
powerful
enough
to
counterbalance
US
influence
.

In
the
late
1980s
,
Japan
seemed
capable
of
challenging
America
â€™s
industrial
leadership
,
but
by
the
1990s
it
lost
its
competitive
edge
.

China
might
itself
wish
to
be
a
major
force
in
a
multi-polar
world
,
but
has
been
plagued
by
its
lack
of
overall
strength
.

Given
these
realities
,
China
sees
the
expanding
European Union
as
a
likely
counterweight
to
unchecked
US
power
.

In
terms
of
economic
output
,
today
â€™s
EU
is
on
par
with
the
US
.

But
it
has
yet
to
build
a
strong
defense
system
that
can
respond
effectively
either
to
regional
contingencies
or
to
global
needs
.

What
would
be
the
strength
of
such
a
system
if
and
when
it
is
developed
,
and
how
will
it
compare
with
that
of
the
US
?

In
assessing
America
â€™s
strength
,
China
follows
US
debates
on
the
merits
of
a
uni-polar
or
a
multi-polar
world
with
keen
interest
.

Some
Americans
favor
a
uni-polar
system
in
which
the
US
dominates
.

Such
a
Pax Americana
Cutting
the
IMF
and
World Bank
Down
to
Size
CAMBRIDGE
:
In
recent
weeks
,
debates
over
the
future
of
the
International Monetary Fund
and
the
World Bank
have
grabbed
headlines
.

A
US Congressional Commission
of
experts
,
on
which
I
served
,
issued
a
report
,
dubbed
the
Meltzer
Report
(
after
the
Commission
â€™s
Chairman
,
economist
Allan Meltzer
)
,
calling
for
dramatic
reforms
of
both
institutions
.

Then
,
Trans-Atlantic
bickering
over
the
selection
of
a
new
IMF
Managing Director
broke
out
.

The
selection
process
was
unpleasant
(
for
example
,
developing
countries
had
no
real
say
)
,
but
in
the
end
,
the
excellent
choice
of
German
Finance
official
Horst Kohler
emerged
.

As
another
important
factor
in
the
debate
,
US
Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers
issued
his
own
calls
for
modest
World Bank
reforms
,
following
proposals
that
he
made
earlier
for
modest
IMF
reforms
.

The
real
debate
is
about
the
scope
of
the
two
institutions
.

During
the
past
20
years
,
the
IMF
and
the
World Bank
played
a
large
role
in
developing
countries
and
in
the
postcommunist
transition
.

Rich
countries
,
especially
the
US
,
used
the
IMF
and
World Bank
as
instruments
of
financial
diplomacy
.

Both
institutions
have
been
used
by
the
US
and
Europe
to
get
money
to
favored
countries
â€“
Mexico
,
Russia
,
or
East Asia
â€“
in
times
of
crisis
.

Both
the
IMF
and
World Bank
have
also
been
empowered
to
impose
strong
conditions
on
the
economic
programs
of
countries
that
turn
to
it
for
help
.

IMF
and
World Bank
critics
,
including
members
of
the
Meltzer Commission
,
think
that
the
two
institutions
are
too
big
,
too
powerful
,
and
too
over-extended
.

The
IMF
tries
to
manage
the
economic
operations
of
more
than
50
countries
.

In
many
cases
,
the
IMF
imposes
its
programs
for
years
or
even
decades
,
far
after
an
economic
emergency
ends
.

It
maintains
its
influence
because
the
US
insists
that
poorer
countries
should
have
IMF
programs
if
they
are
to
receive
relief
on
their
debt
or
receive
other
kinds
of
financial
help
from
outside
the
IMF
.

The
World Bank
lends
money
to
dozens
of
countries
in
hundreds
of
programs
.

Economy
,
Insure
Thyself
NEW HAVEN
â€“
The
basic
principle
of
financial
risk
management
is
sharing
.

The
more
broadly
diversified
our
financial
portfolios
,
the
more
people
there
are
who
share
in
the
inevitable
risks
â€“
and
the
less
an
individual
is
affected
by
any
given
risk
.

The
theoretical
ideal
occurs
when
financial
contracts
spread
the
risks
all
over
the
world
,
so
that
billions
of
willing
investors
each
own
a
tiny
share
,
and
no
one
is
over-exposed
.

The
case
of
Japan
shows
that
,
despite
some
of
our
financial
markets
â€™
great
sophistication
,
we
are
still
a
long
way
from
the
theoretical
ideal
.

Considering
the
huge
risks
that
are
not
managed
well
,
finance
,
even
in
the
twenty-first
century
,
is
actually
still
rather
primitive
.

A
recent
World Bank
study
estimated
that
the
damage
from
the
triple
disaster
(
earthquake
,
tsunami
,
and
nuclear
crisis
)
in
March
might
ultimately
cost
Japan
$
235 billion
(
excluding
the
value
of
lives
tragically
lost
)
.

That
is
about
4
%
of
Japanese
GDP
in
2010
.

Given
wide
publicity
about
international
charitable
relief
efforts
and
voluntary
contributions
to
Japan
,
one
might
think
that
the
country
â€™s
economic
loss
was
shared
internationally
.

But
newspaper
accounts
suggest
that
such
contributions
from
foreign
countries
should
be
put
in
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
US dollars
â€“
well
below
1
%
of
the
total
losses
.

Japan
needed
real
financial
risk
sharing
:
charity
rarely
amounts
to
much
.

Insurance
companies
operating
in
Japan
repaid
some
of
the
losses
.

The
same
World Bank
study
estimates
that
total
claims
accruing
to
insurers
in
Japan
might
ultimately
cost
these
companies
$
33 billion
.

Clearly
,
the
insured
risks
were
a
small
part
of
the
total
risk
.

Moreover
,
much
of
that
risk
,
even
if
insured
,
continues
to
be
borne
in
Japan
,
rather
than
being
spread
effectively
to
foreign
investors
,
so
Japan
is
still
alone
in
bearing
the
costs
.

Before
the
disaster
,
Japan
issued
about
$
1.5 billion
in
earthquake-related
catastrophe
bonds
as
a
risk-management
device
:
the
debt
is
canceled
if
a
precisely
defined
seismic
event
occurs
.

Europe
without
Turkey
AMSTERDAM
â€“
Most
European
citizens
(
for
example
,
more
than
60
%
in
France
and
Germany
)
believe
that
Turkey
should
not
become
part
of
the
European Union
.

There
are
various
reasons
for
this
opposition
â€“
some
valid
,
some
based
on
prejudice
:
Turkey
is
too
big
;
Turkish
migrant
workers
might
swamp
other
members
;
Turkey
has
a
shaky
human rights
record
;
Turkey
oppresses
the
Kurds
;
Turkey
has
nâ€™t
solved
its
problems
with
Greece
over
Cyprus
.

But
the
main
reason
is
surely
that
Turkey
,
a
mostly
Muslim
country
,
governed
by
a
Muslim
party
,
is
viewed
as
too
foreign
.

In
the
words
of
former
French
President
ValÃ©ry Giscard dâ€™Estaing
,
one
of
the
authors
of
the
EU Constitution
,
â€œ
Turkey
is
not
a
European
country
.

This
is
hard
to
take
for
members
of
the
secular
,
Westernized
Turkish
elite
,
who
have
spent
decades
,
if
not
longer
,
trying
to
prove
their
European
bona
fides
.

As
one
highly
educated
Turk
,
working
for
an
international
organization
,
put
it
to
me
recently
:
â€œ
We
play
football
with
them
,
sing
songs
with
them
on
TV
,
do
business
with
them
,
improved
our
human rights
,
and
democratized
our
politics
.

We
do
everything
t
Gaza
Shrugs
GAZA CITY
â€“
Palestinian
President
Mahmoud Abbas
has
now
personally
presented
Palestine
â€™s
bid
for
full
United Nations
membership
to
UN
Secretary-General
Ban Ki-Moon
.

What
remains
to
be
seen
is
whether
Hamas
,
which
has
controlled
the
Gaza Strip
since
June
2007
,
will
eventually
support
this
initiative
by
its
bitter
rival
,
Abbas
â€™s
West Bank-based
Palestinian Authority
.

The
failure
for
more
than
a
year
to
make
any
progress
in
negotiations
with
Israel
has
convinced
Abbas
and
his
colleagues
to
pursue
the
UN
option
.

And
Israel
â€™s
continuing
settlement
construction
on
the
West
Bank
has
sharpened
their
sense
that
negotiations
would
not
be
productive
,
whereas
the
raft
of
UN
resolutions
supporting
a
two-state
solution
could
now
be
put
to
the
test
.

Moreover
,
it
is
widely
believed
that
the
Arab Spring
has
encouraged
the
Palestinian
leadership
to
seek
to
change
the
rules
of
the
game
.

Arabs
throughout
the
region
,
though
preoccupied
with
domestic
affairs
,
are
nonetheless
pressing
a
new
generation
of
leaders
to
support
the
Palestinian
cause
more
actively
.

The
collapse
of
Hosni Mubarak
â€™s
regime
in
Egypt
,
the
subsequent
departure
of
the
Israeli
ambassador
from
Cairo
,
the
political
upheaval
in
Syria
,
and
the
expulsion
of
the
Israeli
ambassador
from
Ankara
are
causing
great
uncertainty
in
Israeli
leadership
circles
.

Israel
is
more
isolated
regionally
and
internationally
than
ever
,
owing
to
Israeli
Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu
diplomatic
failures
.

Abbas
,
whose
bid
is
supported
unanimously
by
the
Arab
and
most
Islamic
countries
,
is
convinced
that
the
Arabs
will
stand
with
the
Palestinians
,
regardless
of
the
consequences
.

More
than
120
countries
are
believed
to
support
the
Palestinian
bid
for
statehood
.

But
the
Palestinians
must
secure
the
approval
of
the
UN Security Council
and
the
support
of
two-thirds
of
the
UN General Assembly
in
order
to
gain
full
official
recognition
.

The
US
has
threatened
to
veto
the
resolution
in
the
Security Council
,
and
the
US Congress
has
threatened
to
suspend
American
aid
to
the
Palestinian Authority
.

Members
of
the
European Union
are
still
divided
and
continue
to
hope
for
a
compromise
and
other
options
.

Israel
has
denounced
the
Palestinian
strategy
as
a
unilateral
initiative
,
and
has
threatened
the
Palestinians
with
severe
reprisals
.

Israeli
Foreign Minister
Avigdor Lieberman
suggested
canceling
the
Oslo
Accords
,
signed
with
the
Palestine Liberation Organization
in
September
1993
,
which
provided
the
basis
for
the
creation
of
the
Palestinian Authority
in
1994
.

Hobble

NEWPORT
BEACH
â€“
Colleagues
from
around
the
world
recently
gathered
at
PIMCO
â€™s
headquarters
in
California
for
our
annual
Secular Forum
,
when
we
leave
behind
high-frequency
issues
for
a
few
days
and
,
instead
,
debate
what
the
next
3-5
years
hold
for
the
global
economy
.

The
perspective
is
global
,
informed
by
the
insights
of
outside
speakers
,
and
the
focus
is
on
what
is
likely
to
happen
,
as
opposed
to
what
should
happen
.

The
last
two
Secular
Forums
projected
that
,
after
the
global
financial
crisis
,
the
world
economy
would
not
reset
in
its
traditional
,
cyclical
manner
.

Instead
,
it
faced
multi-year
re-alignments
of
both
a
national
and
global
nature
.

The
world
economy
would
heal
,
but
in
a
slow
and
uneven
fashion
,
as
advanced
economies
muddled
through
while
the
more
dynamic
emerging
world
gradually
closed
today
â€™s
income
and
wealth
gaps
.

Developments
since
then
have
been
consistent
with
this
characterization
.

The
G-7
recovery
has
been
unusually
sluggish
,
notwithstanding
large
and
unprecedented
policy
stimulus
(
particularly
in
the
US
)
.

As
a
result
,
unemployment
has
surged
,
now
exceeding
that
of
emerging
economies
.

Inside
Iran
â€™s
Nuclear
Reasoning
MELBOURNE
â€“
Is
Iran
really
hell-bent
on
becoming
a
nuclear-armed
state
?

Or
will
it
settle
for
nuclear
capability
,
able
to
make
weapons
but
choosing
not
to
?

Does
the
difference
matter
?

Few
international
questions
involve
higher
stakes
than
these
.

An
immediate
concern
,
if
deep
pessimism
about
Iran
â€™s
intentions
prevails
,
is
a
preventive
Israeli
strike
,
leading
to
another
major
Middle East
war
â€“
with
catastrophic
consequences
for
the
global
economy
likely
.

No
one
should
underestimate
the
difficulty
of
assessing
Iran
â€™s
real
intentions
.

Mixed
signals
from
competing
power
centers
do
nâ€™t
help
;
nor
does
the
recurring
contrast
between
Iranian
officials
â€™
usually-strident
public
pronouncements
and
often-moderate
private
discourse
.

Pessimists
and
skeptics
have
plenty
to
point
to
in
Iran
â€™s
long
record
of
obstruction
and
brinkmanship
in
addressing
legitimate
international
concerns
about
its
nuclear
programs
.

That
said
,
too
many
policymakers
and
commentators
have
rushed
to
judgment
,
insisting
that
Iran
is
irrevocably
determined
to
build
nuclear weapons
,
or
that
it
wants
a
break-out
capability
that
is
just
as
dangerous
.

In
fact
,
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
situation
is
less
alarming
and
more
containable
than
this
.

While
a
negotiated
settlement
acceptable
to
both
Iran
and
the
rest
of
the
international
community
would
be
a
hugely
difficult
undertaking
,
it
is
achievable
.

One
does
not
need
to
look
hard
for
Iran
â€™s
reasons
for
testing
the
limits
of
international
tolerance
:
to
redeem
the
humiliations
of
the
Mosaddeq
era
and
beyond
;
to
demonstrate
superior
technological
prowess
to
the
region
and
the
wider
world
;
and
to
make
clear
to
the
Western
powers
â€“
whose
perceived
double
standards
abandoned
Iran
to
Saddam Hussein
â€™s
chemical
warfare
in
the
late
1980s
â€“
Making
the
Euro
Whole
NEW YORK
â€“
The
architects
of
the
euro
knew
that
it
was
incomplete
when
they
designed
it
.

The
euro
had
a
common
central bank
but
no
common
treasury
.

This
was
unavoidable
,
because
the
Maastricht Treaty
was
meant
to
bring
about
a
monetary
union
without
a
political
union
.

European
authorities
were
confident
,
however
,
that
if
and
when
the
euro
ran
into
a
crisis
,
they
would
be
able
to
overcome
it
.

After
all
,
that
is
how
the
European Union
was
created
,
taking
one
step
at
a
time
,
knowing
full
well
that
additional
steps
would
be
required
.

With
hindsight
,
one
can
identify
other
deficiencies
in
the
euro
of
which
its
architects
were
unaware
.

The
euro
was
supposed
to
bring
about
economic
convergence
,
but
it
produced
divergences
instead
,
because
its
architects
did
not
realize
that
imbalances
may
emerge
not
only
in
the
public
sector
,
but
in
the
private
sector
as
well
.

After
the
euro
came
into
force
,
commercial
banks
could
refinance
their
holdings
of
government
bonds
at
the
discount
window
of
the
European Central Bank
,
and
regulators
treated
government
bonds
as
riskless
.

This
caused
interest-rate
differentials
between
various
countries
to
shrink
,
which
generated
real-estate
booms
in
the
weaker
economies
and
reduced
their
competitiveness
.

At
the
same
time
,
Germany
,
suffering
from
the
after-effects
of
reunification
,
had
to
tighten
its
belt
.

Trade
unions
agreed
to
concessions
on
wages
and
working
conditions
in
exchange
for
job
security
.

That
is
how
the
divergences
emerged
.

Yet
the
banks
continued
to
load
up
on
the
government
bonds
of
the
weaker
countries
in
order
to
benefit
from
the
minuscule
interest-rate
differentials
that
still
remained
.

The
consequences
of
the
lack
of
a
common
treasury
first
became
apparent
after
the
bankruptcy
of
Lehman Brothers
in
2008
,
when
governments
,
in
order
to
prevent
financial
markets
from
collapsing
,
had
to
guarantee
that
no
other
systemically
important
financial institution
would
be
allowed
to
fail
.

At
that
time
,
Angela Merkel
rejected
a
Europe-wide
guarantee
,
insisting
that
each
country
should
guarantee
its
own
institutions
.

No
Nukes
?

NEW YORK
â€“
When
parts
of
Japan
were
devastated
recently
by
an
earthquake
and
subsequent
tsunami
,
news
of
the
human
toll
was
quickly
overshadowed
by
global
fears
of
radioactive
fallout
from
the
Fukushima Daichi
nuclear
power plant
.

The
concern
was
understandable
:
radiation
is
very
frightening
.

I
grew
up
in
Denmark
at
a
time
when
fear
of
nuclear
power
was
pervasive
.

But
our
latest
nuclear
fears
have
broader
implications
,
especially
for
energy
supply
and
our
desire
to
shift
away
from
reliance
on
fossil
fuels
.

It
is
difficult
to
step
back
at
the
time
of
a
natural
disaster
to
gain
a
broader
perspective
;
even
attempting
to
do
so
can
feel
crass
.

But
there
are
some
facts
that
we
should
not
overlook
.

During
the
round-the-clock
coverage
of
the
nuclear
drama
,
the
specter
of
Chernobyl
has
been
raised
repeatedly
.

It
is
worth
noting
that
the
worst
nuclear
disaster
in
history
directly
caused
only
31
fatalities
.

The
World Health Organization
estimates
that
4,000
deaths
could
be
linked
to
the
disaster
over
70
years
,
whereas
the
OECD
projects
a
range
of
9,000
-
33,000
deaths
during
this
period
.

That
is
substantial
.

But
consider
that
,
according
to
the
OECD
,
every
year
nearly
one million
people
die
from
fine-particle
outdoor
air
pollution
.

Yet
this
massive
death
toll
provokes
no
discernible
fear
in
the
developed
world
,
and
receives
virtually
no
news
coverage
.

Of course
,
every
country
with
nuclear
power
facilities
should
revise
its
safety
measures
in
light
of
the
Japanese
disaster
,
which
raised
obvious
questions
about
the
sites
chosen
for
such
facilities
.

Clearly
,
plants
located
near
tsunami-prone
areas
need
to
be
reconsidered
,
and
some
countries
have
power plants
in
disturbingly
close
proximity
to
seismic
faults
â€“
and
to
large
cities
.

But
while
America
â€™s
commitment
to
nuclear
power
was
quickly
reaffirmed
by
President
Barack Obama
,
some
European
governments
took
the
knee-jerk
decision
to
freeze
all
new
nuclear-energy
projects
immediately
,
and
,
in
the
case
of
Germany
,
not
to
extend
the
life
of
existing
reactors
.

Sarkozy
at
Dusk
PARIS
â€“
And
the
next
French
President
will
be
â€¦
the
Socialist Party
â€™s
candidate
FranÃ§ois Hollande
.

A
month
ago
,
any
prediction
uttered
with
such
certainty
would
have
sounded
imprudent
,
if
not
foolish
.

Uncertainty
prevailed
.

Four
candidates
dominated
the
competition
,
and
no
one
would
have
dared
to
predict
which
two
will
make
it
to
the
second
round
run-off
.

Indeed
,
the
race
looked
more
open
than
ever
in
recent
memory
.

Suddenly
,
something
happened
â€“
not
an
event
in
itself
(
though
it
started
with
Hollande
â€™s
first
great
public
rally
in
mid
January
)
,
but
rather
something
that
may
resemble
an
irresistible
process
that
can
be
summarized
as
follows
:
a
majority
of
the
French
want
to
punish
a
president
who
has
fallen
from
their
graces
.

They
might
not
have
dared
to
do
so
had
they
not
found
a
reasonably
credible
alternative
.

Hollande
,
by
appearing
more
sound
and
determined
than
most
French
voters
thought
he
was
,
has
given
a
voice
(
and
a
face
)
to
a
widespread
desire
to
reject
the
incumbent
,
Nicolas Sarkozy
.

That
is
not
to
say
that
Hollande
is
charismatic
.

On
the
contrary
,
there
remain
lingering
doubts
about
his
gravitas
,
not

Striking
Euro
Gold
(
and
Silver
)
PRINCETON
â€“
The
alternatives
for
Europe
â€™s
currency
,
the
euro
,
seem
increasingly
limited
to
a
desperate
muddling
through
or
a
chaotic
collapse
.

But
there
is
a
bolder
and
more
productive
approach
that
relies
on
past
experience
with
multiple
currencies
.

The
threat
posed
by
Europe
â€™s
current
policy
impasse
can
hardly
be
overestimated
.

In
the
early
1930â€™s
,
monetary-policy
incoherence
paralyzed
US
policy
,
with
the
Federal Reserve Bank
of
New York
locked
in
insurmountable
conflict
with
the
Chicago
Fed
over
monetary
easing
(
at
that
time
through
open-market
securities
purchases
)
.

Today
â€™s
chronic
policy
disputes
between
Germany
and
France
are
producing
a
level
of
uncertainty
that
is
potentially
even
more
destructive
.

Every
few
months
,
European
governments
launch
a
new
and
ever
more
ingenious
initiative
to
resolve
the
eurozone
â€™s
debt
crisis
.

For
a
day
(
and
sometimes
only
for
a
few
hours
)
,
financial
markets
rally
euphorically
.

But
soon
doubt
sweeps
back
in
.

There
is
no
sense
of
a
realistic
endgame
.

And
there
is
no
longer-term
vision
of
how
the
fiscal
integration
needed
for
the
effective
operation
of
a
monetary
union
could
be
achieved
in
a
practical
timeframe
.

Europeans
should
look
to
the
past
,
when
previous
crises
produced
innovative
solutions
.

The
extended
crisis
of
the
European Monetary System
(
EMS
)
between
September
1992
and
July
1993
looked
as
if
it
would
derail
European
integration
.

What
was
initially
seen
as
a
problem
in
one
country
(
Italy
)
toppled
other
currency
regimes
like
dominos
:
Britain
,
Spain
,
and
Portugal
â€“
and
,
by
July
1993
,
even
France
was
vulnerable
.

Then
,
as
now
,
Europe
â€™s
future
was
at
stake
.

The
solution
adopted
in
frantic
late-night
negotiations
in
Brussels
initially
looked
counterproductive
.

The
massive
widening
of
the
EMS
bands
to
15
%
on
either
side
of
a
central
parity
initially
made
a
single
currency
appear
more
remote
.

Turkey
â€™s
Class
Struggle
NEW YORK
â€“
One
interpretation
of
the
anti-government
demonstrations
now
roiling
Turkish
cities
is
that
they
are
a
massive
protest
against
political
Islam
.

What
began
as
a
rally
against
official
plans
to
raze
a
small
park
in
the
center
of
Istanbul
to
make
way
for
a
kitschy
shopping
mall
quickly
evolved
into
a
conflict
of
values
.

On
the
surface
,
the
fight
appears
to
represent
two
different
visions
of
modern
Turkey
,
secular
versus
religious
,
democratic
versus
authoritarian
.

Comparisons
have
been
made
with
Occupy Wall Street
.

Some
observers
even
speak
of
a
â€œ
Turkish
Spring
.

The
Defeated
Remain
Defiant
HARARE
:
Before
Zimbabwe
's
Presidential
election
earlier
this
month
,
I
believed
that
if
the
election
were
not
handled
properly
,
there
would
be
serious
fallout
in
the
country
and
throughout
Southern Africa
.

Despite
the
shadows
of
war
and
terrorism
,
I
called
for
a
fair
and
free
election
.

Zimbabwe
's
people
did
not
get
one
.

Instead
,
they
got
terrorism
.

In
the
two
years
that
led
up
to
the
Presidential
vote
,
the
people
of
Zimbabwe
were
subjected
to
severe
intimidation
,
harassment
and
fear
,
all
of
which
was
carried
out
as
part
of
a
broader
program
of
state-sponsored
terrorism
by
Robert Mugabe
's
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
(
ZANU-PF
)
.

ZANU
terrorism
was
conducted
by
rogue
elements
among
the
veterans
of
Zimbabwe
's
war
of
independence
two
decades
ago
,
as well as
by
government
militiamen
and
youths
,
all
of
whom
were
actively
aided
by
the
police
.

This
intimidation
and
violence
meant
that
my
party
,
the
Movement for Democratic Change
(
MDC
)
could
not
reach
the
electorate
in
large
parts
of
the
countryside
.
